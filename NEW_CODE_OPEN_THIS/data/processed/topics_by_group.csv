Have any of you started out on Trulicity? If so, what was your experience? My insurance wants you to try it before Ozempic.  I started out on Ozempic trial. I was losing weight and could only eat about 1/2 of my meals. I always had food left over at meals and even had to throw food away. I vomited once because of nausea as I didn't do well with fatty foods. Steak was the worst.   After the trial i switched to Trulicity and I've regained weight, the appetite suspension is gone, I feel no nausea and can eat whatever, however much I want. It feels like I am taking placebo.   I thought Ozempic and Trulicity were the same thing? I wonder why my experience is so different. I'm on .5 by the way. I started at .25 and then .5."", ""Semaglutide compound isn't an option anymore and Wegovy isn't covered. What's left for me to try?. In early March, my doctor wrote me a prescription for semaglutide and sent me to a nearby compounding pharmacy. It was $250 a month. She recently increased my dose, and I finally started seeing good results.   Last week, I called to refill my prescription, and the pharmacist told me that the FDA wouldn't let them compound the drug anymore. My doctor's office responded by sending in a prescription for Wegovy, but we're still waiting on insurance approval. Based on some documents that I found online, I don't think it'll be covered, and I'm not willing to shell out $800+ per month for the drug.   Has anyone been through this before? Any advice? I'm curious if there are places online that offer the drug for cheaper without insurance. I do this with Tretinoin, and I haven't had an issue.""]"

I restarted Saxenda a few days ago, and as it should it has completely taken away my appetite.  The downside is that I'm extremely fatigued, leaving me with little energy to do daily activities and going to the gym is almost completely out of the question.    So, looking at protein vs. carbs, what should I focus on?  My limited intake needs to be enough to bring my energy back up and carry me through my workouts.  "", 'I Believe I Have PCOS - Scared to Retrigger an Old Eating Disorder, Curious About Metformin/Ozempic (all advice appreciated!). Hey all, I‚Äôve been sitting through this Reddit for about a week now reading all of your heartfelt posts. Thank you to everyone who has shared their experiences, I‚Äôm learning a lot! That being said, I‚Äôm seeking some advice or even just anecdotes regarding Ozempic/Metformin and other potential medications for weight loss.  A bit about my symptoms (feel free to skip):  I‚Äôm 22 years old and my family has a history of PCOS. About a year and a half ago, I suddenly gained roughly 30 lbs. I have been between 120-125 lbs since graduating high school, and before that I was 115 lbs and very very thin. So 30 lbs took me up about 4 sizes all within the matter of 6 months.   During that period of rapid weight gain, I also suddenly began to experience intense irritability and mood swings. I‚Äôm talking intense rage ‚Äî doing things I‚Äôve never done like throwing stuff and screaming. It wasn‚Äôt long before I was sent into a depression, which has only worsened as time has gone on.   I am constantly fatigued, especially during the day. I get nothing done during the day and beat myself up for it all day long because I so desperately want to be productive but the fatigue is terrible. I also have extreme inflammation all over my body (even a light touch to a tender area hurts badly), but I was also hit by a car around a year ago and have suffered some musculoskeletal injuries that could be causing that.   Other than that, my periods have changed a lot. I don‚Äôt keep track of them because I‚Äôm a lesbian so pregnancy isn‚Äôt really an issue, but recently I‚Äôve started bleeding profusely to the point where I have to change my menstrual cup 4-6 times a day for the first couple days. I used to have to empty it maybe twice. I also experience arthritis when I‚Äôm on my period and phantom cramps that lead to nothing. My libido is non-existent which has done significant damage to my very important relationship along with the effects of depression, anxiety, and mood swings.   Question about weight loss medication and eating disorders:  I had anorexia (and potentially binge eating disorder tbh) since about 11 years old and it persisted until the age of about 18/19, when eventually I was able to pull myself out of it. Since then, I‚Äôve been doing intuitive eating which served me very well and I was happier and fitter than ever. Then, PCOS happened. The weight gain is extremely triggering and upsetting. I know I don‚Äôt have to explain to this group why, but let‚Äôs just say that my disgust with my body has infected my self esteem and essentially destroyed any shred of confidence I once had in myself (even regarding my intelligence, capability, competence, etc). I NEED to lose this weight.  But, I know that if I‚Äôm put on any kind of diet my eating disorder will come back stronger than I ever. I feel like I can‚Äôt really win. So, I‚Äôm curious about an insulin sensitizer or GLP-1. The idea that I could get to a comfortable weight without going off the deep end sounds like heaven. I‚Äôm pretty scared to advocate for myself with a doctor and I don‚Äôt want to seem lazy or gluttonous, I just REALLY know that I can‚Äôt restrict myself to an extreme. I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôll still have to make diet changes if I‚Äôm insulin resistant, at least the pressure won‚Äôt be as high to be perfect.  SO, if there‚Äôs anyone in this subreddit who has had an eating disorder and has experience with medication for insulin resistant folks, please let me know what you think üôèüôèüôè Sorry for the long post and thank you!']"

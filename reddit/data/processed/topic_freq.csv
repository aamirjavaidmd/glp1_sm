I\'m 34F and on week 4 and a half of taking Ozempic. I\'m still on the 0.25 dose as my body has not gotten used to it, and I didn\'t feel comfortable going up to the next dose level.  Previous to starting this medication, I had gained a lot of weight from 2020 to 2021 during the pandemic.  Mostly due to a toxic relationship that was overindulgent in fast food and late night eating.    I have since changed my living situation and diet, to go back to my normal habits (eating during the day and less at night, lunch being my biggest meal). I incorporated more fiber rich foods and cut out most dairy products, due to lactose intolerance.    Then to assist with the weight loss I was prescribed Ozempic. I do not have any diabetes or am pre diabetic to my knowledge.   Here are some of my experiences. (Warning might be TMI, but I think this is helpful, for people looking into side effects).  Week 1 & 2:   I noticed my hunger and need for food had disappeared. No change in bowel movement (BM). No vomiting or diarrhea. Diet does not  change. I noticed slight nausea if I ate too much but it subsided quickly.   Week 3:  The day after I took the medication (Sat night) I celebrated with family on Sunday night. I probably ordered the wrong thing (pozole). It was probably too heavy, and oily, for my now slower and more sensitive digestive system.  I did not notice anything till the following Monday when I woke up with bad nausea, I thought maybe I needed some breakfast and ate the rest of the pozole. I also took a Zofran, to help with the nausea. It worked and I went about my day at work and continued as normal, until that night I felt really bad. The nausea was way worse and I had diarrhea and vomiting issues that night. I thought I had food poisoning.  It didn\'t occur to me that this was the drug reacting and actually I had just been eating too much. I had a big lunch that day too.   I took the next day off to recover. I added some Pepto-bismol to my relief kit and a box of electrolyte mix ins. And felt much better the next day. Later that week it appeared that my digestion had gone back to normal and I wasn\'t dealing with as much nausea.   Week 3:  I begin to realize that the first couple of days after I take the dose I have to be careful of what I\'m eating and how much I eat. However it has still not been an easy road. I usually have quick oats and for breakfast and coffee. This week, less than 24hours after taking my .25 dose, I woke up with extreme nausea, and was unable to keep my breakfast down. I wasn\'t very hungry either.  I took breakfast to go, and ended up eating it later.   As the week went on my appetite and digestion improved. However I did have a slight constipation issue earlier in the week too.   Week 4:  This week is almost halfway done. So far I have noticed that again if I eat ""too much"" the next day I will pay the price. But it is getting easier. Trying to figure out what works well  into my diet, especially on the first few days after taking a dose, and dealing with nausea is a challenge. Soup is my friend on those days. Sugary items are only to be eaten in moderation and small quantities.  Fruit is also a concern as they have upset my stomach if eaten closer to dosing time rather than a few days after.  I am going to try to incorporate more fiber into the diet too. But everything has to be in smaller quantities than I\'m normally used to. I also have to remind myself to eat as i don\'t get any hunger signals anymore. If I an feeling very nauseous I\'m not going to eat. And I\'m still not sure how to takle the first two days after dose.   Side note: I have been in contact with my doctors about these issues and while this is definitely not normal, it is expected while on this medication.   These are my experiences.  I\'m interested to see if you all have any tips or tricks for dealing with this drug.', 'Sharing my real experience with Ozempic. I caught the post yesterday about \'people lying about Ozempic\' and was too late to the party to share my experience.  I worked with my doctor last summer and was prescribed Ozempic for weight loss.  At the time, I was 38 yrs old, 6\' 2"", and 365lbs and am Male.  At the time, I had just done my annual checkup and all of my blood work was normal - no high A1C, no high cholesterol, sodium, etc etc.  As a bit of back story to this - In the past, I pretty much would just eat until the food in front of me was gone.  That\'s what I was taught growing up - eat until your plate is clean.  It\'s a habit I\'ve struggled with and have yet to overcome.  I don\'t really know the difference between ""hungry"" and ""not full.""  For me it\'s basically ""I\'m hungry"" and then ""holy shit I\'m so fucking stuffed I could pop.""  So last summer, my doc started me on Ozempic at 0.25mg weekly dosage.  I was at this dose for about 3 months and then increased to 0.5mg weekly.  For the first two months, the change was absolutely un-freaking-believable.  I would sit down to a meal, eat some and actually FEEL FULL.  I was able to easily stop eating with portions of food on my plate and feel completely satisfied.  In those first two months I dropped 15lbs.  In month three, I was still actually feeling full at meals, snacking between meals less, but the weight wasn\'t really dropping any longer.  This is why the doc increased me to 0.5mg.  After starting the 0.5mg/week dose, this is where it all went downhill, fast.  The side effects came on hard, fast and strong.  If I ate more than say half a sandwich at a meal, I would become so overwhelmingly bloated that I was burping constantly (like literally two big burps every 3 minutes for hours).  On top of that, at this point it made my burps smell and taste so ungodly disgusting (think straight sulfur plus an outhouse at a nascar race in summer at the end of race weekend).    Additionally, there were three times in a two week period that I became so bloated that it made me vomit - a lot; and I\'m not exaggerating that it was complete projectile vomiting, out of my mouth and nose.  It was an absolutely ungodly horrible experience.    As if those side effects weren\'t bad enough, it also gave me horrible, uncontrollable diarrhea that met the clinical definition of ""severe"".  There were a few days where I couldn\'t leave the toilet for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.  There was one night I fell asleep on the toilet, because I was so tired from getting up to RUN to the toilet to poo.  Anyways - I stopped taking Ozempic after that experience.  However working with my doc\'s input, I did stop taking it for just over a month (until my system was back to normal) and then tried the 0.25mg dosage again to see if I still had all of the side effects or not - I did.     So the reason to share this is I wanted to put out there my real world experience.  I\'m hopefully in the minority of users that get the horrible side effects, and hopefully your experiences will be better than mine.  The key takeaways for me is that I need to learn the difference between ""full"" and ""not hungry"" and stop treating them as the same feeling.  It also taught me that Yes I indeed can actually make it by without snacking, and without eating a bunch of food at every meal.  Hopefully at some point I\'ll build up better self control and be able to manage that without medication.', 'Sharing my real experience with Ozempic.

Safe prescribing practice is supported through an understanding of the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of medications. This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice. Traditional medical training and clinical practice for chronic disease has long revolved around the teaching of intensifying therapy and evidenced based prescribing, a crucial skill when chronic disease progresses. Now that we are witnessing remission of Type 2 Diabetes through nutritional interventions specifically low carbohydrate diets (LCD) we must apply the same effort and thought to de-prescribing as the underlying metabolic condition improves. There is minimal guidance in the literature on how to actively de-prescribe. The American Diabetes Association in their *Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes–2021* acknowledges low carbohydrate nutritional therapy (LCD) as a viable option in the management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Thus, the goal of our paper is to help close the gap between the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of T2D medications to the practical application and teamwork needed to facilitate safe medication reduction in the primary care setting when applied to a LCD. The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to achieve safe and effective care. The most immediate and important adjustments are to insulin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, blood pressure medications and diuretics. Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycaemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure data responses regularly, and open access communication with the team. The article is an international consensus document on de-prescribing that was put together by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians.  ## Introduction  Healthcare professionals in the primary care setting need to be competent to safely adapt diabetes medications when patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) alter their diet. Safe prescribing practice is supported through an understanding of the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of medications. This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) in their *Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2021* recognize low carbohydrate nutritional therapy as a viable option for the management of T2D. The publication states “For people with type 2 diabetes, low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate eating patterns, in particular, have been found to reduce HemoglobinA1C (HbA1c) and the need for antihyperglycemic medications” ([1]( In addition the *Nutrition Therapy for Adults with Diabetes or Prediabetes: A Consensus Report 2019* states: “Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences. For individuals with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets or for whom reducing glucose-lowering drugs is a priority, reducing overall carbohydrate intake with a low- or very-low-carbohydrate eating pattern is a viable option” ([2]( The report adds, “Use of organization-approved protocols for insulin and other glucose-lowering medications can help reduce therapeutic inertia and/or reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia” ([2]( Furthermore, the 2019 report states “Low-carbohydrate eating patterns, especially very low-carbohydrate (VLC) eating patterns, have been shown to reduce A1C and the need for antihyperglycemic medications. These eating patterns are among the most studied eating patterns for type 2 diabetes” ([2]( The ADA publications are mirrored internationally by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) ([3]( and Diabetes Canada ([4](  Clinical experience finds that a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) can be effective for all forms of diabetes mellitus, including T2D, and those characterized by a low insulin state such as Type 1 Diabetes ([5]( This review will only discuss medication adaptation for T2D. It should be noted that rapid physiologic changes can be expected and close monitoring with timely communication of glucose and medication management is essential to ensure patient safety and optimial efficacy. Potential harms include hypoglycemia due to insulins, and insulin secretagogues, and ketoacidosis due to SGLT2 inhibitors. Equally it is important to consider that carbohydrate restriction should be tailored to the specific needs and health goals of the person living with diabetes.  There is a growing body of published literature discussing the clinical application of a LCD for T2D. Virta Health's report on their novel digitally-monitored continuous care intervention at 2 years demonstrated sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health while utilizing less medication ([6]( In a primary care setting in United Kingdom, Dr. David Unwin published his patient data over 6 years ([7]( The findings from Unwin et al. include: (1) For those choosing a lower carbohydrate dietary approach for an average of 23 months it is possible to achieve a 46% drug-free T2D remission rate in UK primary care while also achieving significant improvements in weight, blood pressure and lipid profiles; (2) in patients with prediabetes, a LCD approach reduced HbA1c to within a non-diabetes threshold in 93% of patients; (3) participants who started with the highest HbA1c saw the greatest improvements in glycemic control ([7]( These clinical findings of a LCD compare favorably to historical usual care for T2D. The usual-care control arm of the DiRECT Trial achieved <2% achieved A1C <6.5% ([8](  Achieving tight glycemic targets is important for preventing microvascular complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. However, modern treatment of T2DM using pharmacological approaches does not consistently achieve HbA1c targets. Higher HbA1c is associated with more diabetes complications, morbidity, and mortality ([9]( Lowering HbA1C alone does not always reduce complications. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial demonstrated that intensive medical treatment carries an increased risk of all-cause mortality, a 35% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, and a greater risk of hypoglycemic events and weight gain of 10 kg compared to those on standard insulin therapy ([10]( Other multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled trials that used medications to achieve tight glycemic targets did not demonstrate the expected reductions in heart disease or in overall mortality ([11]( There is strong evidence for an alternative approach to treating people with T2DM.  Despite the acceptance of reducing carbohydrates as a powerful option in the T2D management there is still a certain amount of clinical inertia and a large gap between the awareness of the benefits of this intervention and the practical application. Even in the recent 63 page publication in the Lancet from the Lancet Commission on Diabetes that embodies 4 years of extensive work to make recommendations to improve clinical practice, carbohydrates are only mentioned once and only in relation to adjusting insulin doses ([17](  ## The Low Carbohydrate Diet in Type 2 Diabetes  Dietary carbohydrate restriction and LCD has lacked a consistent definition and has been used to refer to carbohydrate intake levels that are low only in relation to population averages, often measured as a percentage of kcals, but do not reach the therapeutic levels of restriction necessary to address insulin resistance and T2D. In some reported studies, a LCD has included up to 45% of daily calories from carbohydrates. For an individual consuming 2,500 calories a day this would be 280 g of carbohydrates. A LCD by some definitions comprises <130 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day which is <50% of the average daily intake in the UK and US. Reduction to levels below 50 grams of digestible carbohydrates a day are often needed to fully address insulin resistance and promote T2D remission. Digestible carbohydrate is defined as simple sugars and complex carbohydrates such as starch, which is digested to glucose; this is in contrast to fiber, which is a carbohydrate that is not digested or is only partly digested with the aid of intestinal bacteria. Recommended food choices on a lower carbohydrate meal plan include (1) non-starchy vegetables, (2) protein-containing foods such as fish, meat, poultry, and eggs, (3) natural fats such as olive oil and butter and (4) foods that naturally contain fats, fiber, and/or protein such as nuts, olives, and avocado. Sugar and refined, starchy carbohydrates are eliminated or greatly reduced.  ### Defining Therapeutic Carbohydrate Reduction and Low Carbohydrate Diets (LCD)  There are many ways to implement dietary carbohydrate reduction. The following represents some proposed definitions that represent the variety of therapeutic approaches including in carbohydrate reduction. These are based on protocols currently in use and on definitions found in the literature ([18](  VLCK (very low-carbohydrate ketogenic) meal plan recommend 30 g or less of dietary carbohydrate per day without restriction of kilocalorie (kcal). Instead, VLCK and LCK diets rely upon satiety to guide caloric needs.  LCK (low-carbohydrate ketogenic) meal plans recommend 30–50 g of dietary carbohydrate per day without restriction of kcals. Sometimes “net carbs” (calculated by total carbohydrate minus fiber) will be used with a goal of 25–30 g net carbs/day.  RC (reduced-carbohydrate) meal plans recommend at least 50 g, but <130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day, a level that is higher than therapeutic levels listed above and lower than the U.S. Institute of Medicine dietary reference intake (DRI) for carbohydrate. Restriction of kcals may or may not be recommended at this level.  MCCR (moderate-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted) meal plans recommend more than 130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day with a range of 45–65% of daily kcals coming from carbohydrate ([18]( In most cases, kcals are also restricted to maintain energy balance or to or promote weight loss. This dietary intervention reflects the amount of dietary carbohydrate typically found in the “*carbohydrate counting” dietary intervention that is given to many people with T2DM*.  This article follows common practice in using the term “low-carbohydrate diet” or LCD to refer to a variety of carbohydrate-reduction therapies implemented in clinical settings that fall below 130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day. However, the specific protocol under discussion here is a LCK diet. Clinicians should note that other interventions for remission of T2DM, such as very low-calorie diets or intermittent fasting, effectively reduce carbohydrate intake as part of overall kcal reduction. Conversely, reducing carbohydrate intake in practice often serves to reduce overall kcal. Recommendations for kcal restriction or “calorie counting” are not typically part of VLCK and LCK clinical interventions, but may be used in research protocols.  Immediate diabetes and even blood pressure medication reduction or elimination is standard care in patients undergoing gastric bypass. The practice is similar in patients undergoing a very low calorie low carbohydrate protocol. An example of this was in the DiRECT trial that required: “All oral antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs to be discontinued on day 1 of the weight management programme, with standard protocols for drug reintroduction under national clinical guidelines, if indicated by regular monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure. The clinical emphasis must be on glucose and blood pressure monitoring especially in the first weeks” ([8](  Other examples of studies are listed in [Table 1]( that provide some guidance on the medication adjustments and frequency of monitoring for diabetes and antihypertension medications.  &#x200B;  [Table 1](  ## Categories of Drugs Used in T2DM Patients-Specific Medications and Mechanisms  A brief summary of various agents used for diabetes and their mechanisms and adverse effects are provided below ([1]( [3]( [4](  1. **Biguanides**–Metformin is the only drug in this class. Metformin reduces liver glucose output and slightly lowers insulin resistance in muscles and adipose tissue, and can decrease intestinal glucose uptake. Advere effects can include gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, vitamin B12 deficiency, worsening of neuropathic symptoms. Side effects can be mitigated with extended release preparation. Metformin has numerous beneficial pleitropic actions, the consideration of which is outside the scope of this article.  2. **Sulfonylureas** include glyburide, glibenclamide, glipizide, glimiperide, gliclazide. Sulfonylureas stimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin. Adverse effects include hypoglycemia, weight gain and potential pancreatic beta cell failure.  3. **DPP-IV inhibitors** include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin. These agents prevent the breakdown of GLP-1 hormone which lowers glucagon, increases insulin, slows gastric emptying, and reduces the appetite in a glucose dependent manner. These medications have less A1C lowering compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Infrequent adverse effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and headache.  4. **Thiazolidinediones (TZD)** include pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. These agents improve insulin resistance, but can contribute to weight gain due to insulin sensitivity in the adipose tissue. They are associated with many adverse effects such as peripheral edema, osteoporosis, heart failure as well as a risk of new primary bladder cancer.  5. **Meglitinides** include nataglinide and repaglinide. These cause the pancreas to release more insulin. Similar to sulfonylureas but with a shorter half-life, they more frequent dosing and have slightly lower risk of hypoglycemia.  6. **Alpha glucosidase inhibitors** include acarbose and miglitol. They prevent absorption of carbohydrates and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms including gas and bloating.  7. **Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)** include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin. These agents prevent the kidneys from absorbing glucose back into the bloodstream so more is excreted in the urine. They can cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (even in T2DM patients), genital bacterial and fungal infections, dehydration and hypotension. Several agents in this class have been shown to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease and to have cardioprotective effects.  8. **Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA)** include exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglitide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide. They increase GLP-1 which leads to a glucose dependent increase in insulin and decrease in glucagon which leads to decreased glucose including postprandial glucose. They also delay gastric emptying and enhance satiety which helps facilitate weight loss. They are more potent than DPP-4 inhibitors. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pancreatitis. They are contraindicated if a patient has a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer.  9. **Basal insulins** include insulin glargine, insulin detemir, insulin glargine U300, Degludec U100, U200, Humulin U-500, and NPH. Insulin stimulates glucose to be taken up by muscle, liver, fat cells, and brain tissue. Insulin also inhibits glucagon action so is anti-catabolic. Supra-physiologic doses in those with insulin resistance may increase hunger and contribute to weight gain. Adverse effects include hypoglycemia and lipodystrophy.  10. **Bolus insulins** include Regular, Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine, lispro-aabc, and inhaled insulin. Effects are similar to basal insulin but they are shorter acting and ware off more quickly.  11. **Amylin Mimetics** include pramlintide which is less commonly used since it requires multiple daily injections in addition to meal-time insulin. Pramlintide is a synthetic hormone that resembles human amylin, a hormone that is produced by the pancreas and released into the blood after meals where it helps the body to regulate levels of blood glucose. Amylin slows the rate at which food (including glucose) is absorbed from the intestine and reduces the production of glucose by the liver by inhibiting the action of glucagon. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia.  12. **Other agents with T2D indications**. Bromocriptine and bile acid sequestrants have also been used with some efficacy in management of T2D.  ## Diabetes Medications and a Low Carbohydrate Diet  Diabetes medications work by different mechanisms of action and vary based on their benefits and risks. This is important to consider in light of new evidence for various diabetes agents. A summary table of risks to benefits can be found in [Table 2](  &#x200B;  [Table 2](  What is most significant with diabetes medications and a LCD is that blood glucose levels typically fall rapidly and substantially when an individual adopts a LCD. It is therefore essential that medications are adjusted in order to prevent hypoglycemia. The following recommendations are based on combined clinical expertise, clinical trials, and from current published guidelines on LCD and medications.  When deciding the safety and appropriateness of T2D medications with a LCD there are three key clinical considerations:  ° Is there a risk of the drug causing hypoglycemia or other adverse events?  ° What is the degree of carbohydrate restriction?  ° Once carbohydrates are reduced, does the drug continue to provide health benefit, and if so, are the potential benefits greater than or less than the possible risks and side effects?  The preferences of the person with diabetes should be taken into account in all decisions on medication changes. Clinicians must support patients by balancing the pros and cons of different approaches. Cost is an issue that may influence medication choice in many health care systems. Medication costs are a large burden to individuals and the health systems so it is advisable before prescribing expensive medication that all other options have been considered. Cardiovascular and renal benefits of certain medications should be taken into consideration and may warrant continued use even when a person has met their A1C target. An easy approach to consider when adjusting medications is using a stop light approach (see [Figure 1](  &#x200B;    ### Medications That Create a Risk of Hypoglycemia  A risk of hypoglycemia exists with sulfonylureas, meglinitides, and exogenous insulins. When carbohydrate intake is reduced, these medications need to be reduced or stopped, with adjustment being individualized to patient circumstances. The authors recommend at least a 50% reduction in dose of insulins while stopping the sulfonylureas and meglinitides. Further reductions in insulin may be necessary according to the blood glucose response. There may be a period of short term hyperglycemia while the individual adapts to a lower carbohydrate intake; this is preferable to the risk of hypoglycemia from not reducing doses. These patients benefit from reducing hyperinsulinemia as this is thought to contribute to many of the metabolic and other abnormalities seen in type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia can contribute to increased hunger, making it more difficult to lose weight ([25](  #### Sulfonylureas and Meglitinides  The absence of long-term health benefits of these drugs provides reassurance that stopping them will not adversely affect long term health. Sulfonylureas as second line drugs may increase risk of myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and severe hypoglycemia especially in the elderly, compared with remaining on metformin monotherapy ([26]( Glucose variability and glucose spikes may also be associated with increased cardiovascular risk ([27]( [28](  #### Insulins  Unless embarking on an 800 kcal/day very low calorie and low carbohydrate diet similar to DiRECT, practical expertise suggests a 50% reduction of total daily insulin dose at initiation of the LCD is appropriate in most cases. In individuals whose HbA1c is markedly elevated, a smaller reduction (e.g., of 30%) may be appropriate, with further reductions over time. In individuals on a basal bolus regimen, it is advised to preferentially reduce or stop bolus insulin. As glucose levels improve, basal insulin can then be reduced. Mixed insulin should be stopped and switched to basal insulin alone and the daily dose can be reduced by 30–50% at the start of LCD. If on a single dose of long-acting insulin with a peak, the preferred timing is to administer in the morning to coincide with higher insulin levels with normal circadian physiology of daytime feeding and a reduction of circulating insulin with a nighttime fast. Many basal insulins do not have a high peak especially with reduced doses, allowing it to be administered at any time of day. Some patients can expect to eliminate the need for insulin completely, over days or months, as insulin resistance resolves.  It should be cautioned that some people diagnosed with T2D may in fact have an insulin deficiency form of diabetes, such as Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) or Maturity Onset Diabetes of Youth (MODY). These patients should not have their insulin stopped completely. Endogenous insulin insufficiency is more likely in patients who were not overweight at diagnosis of diabetes or required insulin earlier in their course of diagnosis ([29]( They are also likely to be more insulin sensitive, requiring smaller insulin doses than typically used in T2D. Over-reduction in insulin dosage in these patients would lead to significant hyperglycemia, and further dosage reduction should be avoided. It is recommended that expert advice and additional testing such as c-peptide and GAD antibodies is sought in cases of doubt.  ### Medications That Increase Ketoacidosis Risk  #### SGLT2 Inhibitors  These medications carry a risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis. A LCD alone cannot cause ketoacidosis, but it may enhance the risk posed by SGLT2i's by lowering insulin levels because insulin inhibits ketone formation. SGLT2i-induced ketoacidosis may occur with normal blood glucose levels, and this heightens the risk of ketoacidosis going unrecognized. It is worth noting that a very low carbohydrate diet (typically <50 g of carbohydrate a day) can produce a physiologically normal state of ketosis, that should not be confused with the pathological state of diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite recent literature supporting slight cardiovascular risk reduction and renal protection of SGLT2i's, it is recommended that SGLT2i's are used with caution in those adhering to a low carbohydrate eating plan. It is appropriate to stop SGLT2i's in many cases, particularly in those adhering a very low carbohydrate diet (30–50 g/day). A GLP-1 agonist is a safer choice as a second-line agent after metformin. An excellent review of the physiology of a LCD mimicking many effects of SGLT2i was recently pubished by Murray et al. ([30](  ### Medications With Minimal Risk but Little to No Benefit  #### Thiazolidinediones  These agents are safe to continue from a short-term perspective as they do not cause hypoglycemia. Concerns exist over their long-term safety, including risks of bladder cancer ([31]( heart failure ([32]( and reduced bone mineral density ([33]( It is recommended to stop thiazolidinediones as soon as glucose levels allow. Thiazolidinediones are also know to cause weight gain ([34](  #### Acarbose  Although acarbose is safe to continue whileon commencing on a LCD, the benefits are much less pronounced because of reduced starch ingestion so the patient can usually stop the medication.  ### Medications That Pose No Excess Risk With a LCD and May Have Benefit  ***Metformin*** is safe to continue and in some patients continues to offer favorable benefits. There is no hypoglycemia associated with metformin and neutral or minor weight loss. However, up to 25% of people experience gastrointestinal side effects from metformin ([35](  ***GLP-1 agonists***: Safe to continue. Benefits with a LCD include increased satiety and slowed gastric emptying ([36]( and cardiovascular benefits ([37]( With a sustained LCD, people may be able to stop their GLP-1 agonist. However, guidelines encourage continued use for those with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk independent of A1C. For a detailed review of the multiple mechanisms of this class of medications refer to the full review from Drucker ([38](  ***DPP4 inhibitors*** are less potent than GLP-1 agonists but safe to continue as they do not cause hypoglycemia and are weight neutral. Clinical experience from the International group of authors agreed these seem to have little blood glucose lowering effect in the context of a LCD.  A summary of medication adjustments for diabetes can be found in [Table 3]( [Appendix 1]( is a list of current published clinical guidelines on LCD with medication reduction suggestions.  &#x200B;    ### Individualization of Therapy and the Role of Blood Glucose Monitoring  For those individuals who wish to adopt a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet (<50 grams of carbohydrate/day), a significant reduction or complete discontinuation of insulin may be required. Self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be very helpful in providing rapid feedback on how foods affect blood glucose as a person adopts a LCD, and to inform whether medication doses can be reduced further. There is evidence that frequent paired glucose testing is effective in supporting appropriate food choices, regardless of the type of diabetes treatment ([39]( [40]( Patients on drugs that increase the risk hypoglycemia should have access to rescue therapies (glucose tablets/gel or glucagon), an adequate supply of testing strips, and immediate access to a member of the health care team. This is especially important at the initiation of carbohydrate reduction. Checking blood glucose for the purpose of feedback and behavior change can be extremely effective ([41](  It can be highly educational for patients to see their own glycemic response to food correlated to how they feel. This is now possible with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and has recently become more accessible and affordable with improved CGM technology. Such systems can show the large post-meal glucose spikes and increased glucose variability that are common in patients who have a standard high carbohydrate dietary patterns, are insulin-resistant, and in later stage T2D with beta cell insufficiency. The CGM can also show the impact of a LCD on reducing glucose spikes after meals ([41]( [42](  ### Anti-hypertensive Medication Adjustment  It is important to review the medication list for anti-hypertensives. Blood pressure will need to be monitored either at home or in the clinic during initiation of the dietary intervention. Patients should be shown how to self-monitor blood pressure and be made aware of symptoms of low blood pressure, such as light-headedness upon standing or severe fatigue. These symptoms and/or systolic blood pressure below 120 should prompt reduction of anti-hypertensive medication. Hyponatremia may be exacerbated by SGLT2is, thiazides, or loop diuretics. The initiation of the diet is associated with diuresis and natriuesis; therefore, adequate sodium intake is emphasized to prevent dehydration and hypotension. From a recent review in J Hypertension, they stated that from “Our analysis suggests that insulin plays a primary role in hypertension, highlighting the tight link between essential hypertension and diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome” ([43](  Boullion or broth with sodium is a good remedy as well as preventive measure in the initiation phase of the diet. Some patients with heart failure are salt sensitive so monitor this subgroup closely or reduce diuretics judiciously instead of advising sodium rich broths or foods. Tailor any reduction in anti-hypertensives to the patient's co-mordidities. Results of Dr David Unwin's 6 year observational trial showed a 10.9 mmHG reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.3 mmHG diastolic blood pressure reduction despite a 20% reduction in anti-hypertension medication ([44](  ### Other Medications Needing Adjustment  If there is a significant change in intake of leafy greens or other foods containing vitamin K, vitamin K antagonists (i.e., warfarin) will need frequent monitoring. Improvements in heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease) may allow reduction or elimination of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers. Diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome may also improve with more bioavailable food containing essential proteins and fats. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may see an improvement in their condition with a return of fertility so advice on contraception may be required. Migraines and inflammatory joint pains also may improve and require medication adjustment. Due to the natural diuresis which occurs with insulin reduction and glycogen depletion, if loop diuretics are given for edema these can be safely reduced or removed as the edema is monitored.  ### Other Lifestyle Interventions to Affect Insulin Resistance and Aid in Medication Reduction  Physical activity of all forms can assist insulin sensitivity. This can be just the general movement of walking and having an active day, to directed aerobic type activity, as well as high intensity activity and strength training. Adequate sleep, reducing stress, emerging data on the microbiome, time restricted eating, Vitamin D status, genetics, and multiple other modulators of insulin resistance and sensitivity are now being discovered and individually tailored by clinicians and patients. Discussion of these topics is beyond the scope of this paper.  ## Discussion  The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. A recent qualitative review reports medication reduction to be a primary reason for patients to start a LCD, even more important than weight loss ([45]( Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to acheve safe and effective care. The most immediate and important adjustments are to insulin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2iss, blood pressure medications and diuretics. Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance above, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure responses regularly, and open access communication with the team.  Medical education and practice for decades has focused almost exclusively in prescribing and intensifying medical therapy as chronic disease progresses. Our international team of clinician authors hope for a day when medical education and practice will spend as much time, thought, and effort into safely de-prescribing medications as our patients restore health."", ""Adapting Medication for Type 2 Diabetes to a Low Carbohydrate Diet -- the goal of our paper is to help close the gap between the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of T2D medications to the practical application and teamwork needed to facilitate safe medication reduction...Aug9,2021.

Safe prescribing practice is supported through an understanding of the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of medications. This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice. Traditional medical training and clinical practice for chronic disease has long revolved around the teaching of intensifying therapy and evidenced based prescribing, a crucial skill when chronic disease progresses. Now that we are witnessing remission of Type 2 Diabetes through nutritional interventions specifically low carbohydrate diets (LCD) we must apply the same effort and thought to de-prescribing as the underlying metabolic condition improves. There is minimal guidance in the literature on how to actively de-prescribe. The American Diabetes Association in their *Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes–2021* acknowledges low carbohydrate nutritional therapy (LCD) as a viable option in the management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Thus, the goal of our paper is to help close the gap between the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of T2D medications to the practical application and teamwork needed to facilitate safe medication reduction in the primary care setting when applied to a LCD. The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to achieve safe and effective care. The most immediate and important adjustments are to insulin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, blood pressure medications and diuretics. Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycaemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure data responses regularly, and open access communication with the team. The article is an international consensus document on de-prescribing that was put together by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians.  ## Introduction  Healthcare professionals in the primary care setting need to be competent to safely adapt diabetes medications when patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) alter their diet. Safe prescribing practice is supported through an understanding of the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of medications. This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) in their *Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2021* recognize low carbohydrate nutritional therapy as a viable option for the management of T2D. The publication states “For people with type 2 diabetes, low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate eating patterns, in particular, have been found to reduce HemoglobinA1C (HbA1c) and the need for antihyperglycemic medications” ([1]( In addition the *Nutrition Therapy for Adults with Diabetes or Prediabetes: A Consensus Report 2019* states: “Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences. For individuals with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets or for whom reducing glucose-lowering drugs is a priority, reducing overall carbohydrate intake with a low- or very-low-carbohydrate eating pattern is a viable option” ([2]( The report adds, “Use of organization-approved protocols for insulin and other glucose-lowering medications can help reduce therapeutic inertia and/or reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia” ([2]( Furthermore, the 2019 report states “Low-carbohydrate eating patterns, especially very low-carbohydrate (VLC) eating patterns, have been shown to reduce A1C and the need for antihyperglycemic medications. These eating patterns are among the most studied eating patterns for type 2 diabetes” ([2]( The ADA publications are mirrored internationally by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) ([3]( and Diabetes Canada ([4](  Clinical experience finds that a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) can be effective for all forms of diabetes mellitus, including T2D, and those characterized by a low insulin state such as Type 1 Diabetes ([5]( This review will only discuss medication adaptation for T2D. It should be noted that rapid physiologic changes can be expected and close monitoring with timely communication of glucose and medication management is essential to ensure patient safety and optimial efficacy. Potential harms include hypoglycemia due to insulins, and insulin secretagogues, and ketoacidosis due to SGLT2 inhibitors. Equally it is important to consider that carbohydrate restriction should be tailored to the specific needs and health goals of the person living with diabetes.  There is a growing body of published literature discussing the clinical application of a LCD for T2D. Virta Health's report on their novel digitally-monitored continuous care intervention at 2 years demonstrated sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health while utilizing less medication ([6]( In a primary care setting in United Kingdom, Dr. David Unwin published his patient data over 6 years ([7]( The findings from Unwin et al. include: (1) For those choosing a lower carbohydrate dietary approach for an average of 23 months it is possible to achieve a 46% drug-free T2D remission rate in UK primary care while also achieving significant improvements in weight, blood pressure and lipid profiles; (2) in patients with prediabetes, a LCD approach reduced HbA1c to within a non-diabetes threshold in 93% of patients; (3) participants who started with the highest HbA1c saw the greatest improvements in glycemic control ([7]( These clinical findings of a LCD compare favorably to historical usual care for T2D. The usual-care control arm of the DiRECT Trial achieved <2% achieved A1C <6.5% ([8](  Achieving tight glycemic targets is important for preventing microvascular complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. However, modern treatment of T2DM using pharmacological approaches does not consistently achieve HbA1c targets. Higher HbA1c is associated with more diabetes complications, morbidity, and mortality ([9]( Lowering HbA1C alone does not always reduce complications. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial demonstrated that intensive medical treatment carries an increased risk of all-cause mortality, a 35% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, and a greater risk of hypoglycemic events and weight gain of 10 kg compared to those on standard insulin therapy ([10]( Other multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled trials that used medications to achieve tight glycemic targets did not demonstrate the expected reductions in heart disease or in overall mortality ([11]( There is strong evidence for an alternative approach to treating people with T2DM.  Despite the acceptance of reducing carbohydrates as a powerful option in the T2D management there is still a certain amount of clinical inertia and a large gap between the awareness of the benefits of this intervention and the practical application. Even in the recent 63 page publication in the Lancet from the Lancet Commission on Diabetes that embodies 4 years of extensive work to make recommendations to improve clinical practice, carbohydrates are only mentioned once and only in relation to adjusting insulin doses ([17](  ## The Low Carbohydrate Diet in Type 2 Diabetes  Dietary carbohydrate restriction and LCD has lacked a consistent definition and has been used to refer to carbohydrate intake levels that are low only in relation to population averages, often measured as a percentage of kcals, but do not reach the therapeutic levels of restriction necessary to address insulin resistance and T2D. In some reported studies, a LCD has included up to 45% of daily calories from carbohydrates. For an individual consuming 2,500 calories a day this would be 280 g of carbohydrates. A LCD by some definitions comprises <130 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day which is <50% of the average daily intake in the UK and US. Reduction to levels below 50 grams of digestible carbohydrates a day are often needed to fully address insulin resistance and promote T2D remission. Digestible carbohydrate is defined as simple sugars and complex carbohydrates such as starch, which is digested to glucose; this is in contrast to fiber, which is a carbohydrate that is not digested or is only partly digested with the aid of intestinal bacteria. Recommended food choices on a lower carbohydrate meal plan include (1) non-starchy vegetables, (2) protein-containing foods such as fish, meat, poultry, and eggs, (3) natural fats such as olive oil and butter and (4) foods that naturally contain fats, fiber, and/or protein such as nuts, olives, and avocado. Sugar and refined, starchy carbohydrates are eliminated or greatly reduced.  ### Defining Therapeutic Carbohydrate Reduction and Low Carbohydrate Diets (LCD)  There are many ways to implement dietary carbohydrate reduction. The following represents some proposed definitions that represent the variety of therapeutic approaches including in carbohydrate reduction. These are based on protocols currently in use and on definitions found in the literature ([18](  VLCK (very low-carbohydrate ketogenic) meal plan recommend 30 g or less of dietary carbohydrate per day without restriction of kilocalorie (kcal). Instead, VLCK and LCK diets rely upon satiety to guide caloric needs.  LCK (low-carbohydrate ketogenic) meal plans recommend 30–50 g of dietary carbohydrate per day without restriction of kcals. Sometimes “net carbs” (calculated by total carbohydrate minus fiber) will be used with a goal of 25–30 g net carbs/day.  RC (reduced-carbohydrate) meal plans recommend at least 50 g, but <130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day, a level that is higher than therapeutic levels listed above and lower than the U.S. Institute of Medicine dietary reference intake (DRI) for carbohydrate. Restriction of kcals may or may not be recommended at this level.  MCCR (moderate-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted) meal plans recommend more than 130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day with a range of 45–65% of daily kcals coming from carbohydrate ([18]( In most cases, kcals are also restricted to maintain energy balance or to or promote weight loss. This dietary intervention reflects the amount of dietary carbohydrate typically found in the “*carbohydrate counting” dietary intervention that is given to many people with T2DM*.  This article follows common practice in using the term “low-carbohydrate diet” or LCD to refer to a variety of carbohydrate-reduction therapies implemented in clinical settings that fall below 130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day. However, the specific protocol under discussion here is a LCK diet. Clinicians should note that other interventions for remission of T2DM, such as very low-calorie diets or intermittent fasting, effectively reduce carbohydrate intake as part of overall kcal reduction. Conversely, reducing carbohydrate intake in practice often serves to reduce overall kcal. Recommendations for kcal restriction or “calorie counting” are not typically part of VLCK and LCK clinical interventions, but may be used in research protocols.  Immediate diabetes and even blood pressure medication reduction or elimination is standard care in patients undergoing gastric bypass. The practice is similar in patients undergoing a very low calorie low carbohydrate protocol. An example of this was in the DiRECT trial that required: “All oral antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs to be discontinued on day 1 of the weight management programme, with standard protocols for drug reintroduction under national clinical guidelines, if indicated by regular monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure. The clinical emphasis must be on glucose and blood pressure monitoring especially in the first weeks” ([8](  Other examples of studies are listed in [Table 1]( that provide some guidance on the medication adjustments and frequency of monitoring for diabetes and antihypertension medications.  &#x200B;  [Table 1](  ## Categories of Drugs Used in T2DM Patients-Specific Medications and Mechanisms  A brief summary of various agents used for diabetes and their mechanisms and adverse effects are provided below ([1]( [3]( [4](  1. **Biguanides**–Metformin is the only drug in this class. Metformin reduces liver glucose output and slightly lowers insulin resistance in muscles and adipose tissue, and can decrease intestinal glucose uptake. Advere effects can include gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, vitamin B12 deficiency, worsening of neuropathic symptoms. Side effects can be mitigated with extended release preparation. Metformin has numerous beneficial pleitropic actions, the consideration of which is outside the scope of this article.  2. **Sulfonylureas** include glyburide, glibenclamide, glipizide, glimiperide, gliclazide. Sulfonylureas stimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin. Adverse effects include hypoglycemia, weight gain and potential pancreatic beta cell failure.  3. **DPP-IV inhibitors** include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin. These agents prevent the breakdown of GLP-1 hormone which lowers glucagon, increases insulin, slows gastric emptying, and reduces the appetite in a glucose dependent manner. These medications have less A1C lowering compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Infrequent adverse effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and headache.  4. **Thiazolidinediones (TZD)** include pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. These agents improve insulin resistance, but can contribute to weight gain due to insulin sensitivity in the adipose tissue. They are associated with many adverse effects such as peripheral edema, osteoporosis, heart failure as well as a risk of new primary bladder cancer.  5. **Meglitinides** include nataglinide and repaglinide. These cause the pancreas to release more insulin. Similar to sulfonylureas but with a shorter half-life, they more frequent dosing and have slightly lower risk of hypoglycemia.  6. **Alpha glucosidase inhibitors** include acarbose and miglitol. They prevent absorption of carbohydrates and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms including gas and bloating.  7. **Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)** include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin. These agents prevent the kidneys from absorbing glucose back into the bloodstream so more is excreted in the urine. They can cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (even in T2DM patients), genital bacterial and fungal infections, dehydration and hypotension. Several agents in this class have been shown to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease and to have cardioprotective effects.  8. **Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA)** include exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglitide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide. They increase GLP-1 which leads to a glucose dependent increase in insulin and decrease in glucagon which leads to decreased glucose including postprandial glucose. They also delay gastric emptying and enhance satiety which helps facilitate weight loss. They are more potent than DPP-4 inhibitors. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pancreatitis. They are contraindicated if a patient has a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer.  9. **Basal insulins** include insulin glargine, insulin detemir, insulin glargine U300, Degludec U100, U200, Humulin U-500, and NPH. Insulin stimulates glucose to be taken up by muscle, liver, fat cells, and brain tissue. Insulin also inhibits glucagon action so is anti-catabolic. Supra-physiologic doses in those with insulin resistance may increase hunger and contribute to weight gain. Adverse effects include hypoglycemia and lipodystrophy.  10. **Bolus insulins** include Regular, Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine, lispro-aabc, and inhaled insulin. Effects are similar to basal insulin but they are shorter acting and ware off more quickly.  11. **Amylin Mimetics** include pramlintide which is less commonly used since it requires multiple daily injections in addition to meal-time insulin. Pramlintide is a synthetic hormone that resembles human amylin, a hormone that is produced by the pancreas and released into the blood after meals where it helps the body to regulate levels of blood glucose. Amylin slows the rate at which food (including glucose) is absorbed from the intestine and reduces the production of glucose by the liver by inhibiting the action of glucagon. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia.  12. **Other agents with T2D indications**. Bromocriptine and bile acid sequestrants have also been used with some efficacy in management of T2D.  ## Diabetes Medications and a Low Carbohydrate Diet  Diabetes medications work by different mechanisms of action and vary based on their benefits and risks. This is important to consider in light of new evidence for various diabetes agents. A summary table of risks to benefits can be found in [Table 2](  &#x200B;  [Table 2](  What is most significant with diabetes medications and a LCD is that blood glucose levels typically fall rapidly and substantially when an individual adopts a LCD. It is therefore essential that medications are adjusted in order to prevent hypoglycemia. The following recommendations are based on combined clinical expertise, clinical trials, and from current published guidelines on LCD and medications.  When deciding the safety and appropriateness of T2D medications with a LCD there are three key clinical considerations:  ° Is there a risk of the drug causing hypoglycemia or other adverse events?  ° What is the degree of carbohydrate restriction?  ° Once carbohydrates are reduced, does the drug continue to provide health benefit, and if so, are the potential benefits greater than or less than the possible risks and side effects?  The preferences of the person with diabetes should be taken into account in all decisions on medication changes. Clinicians must support patients by balancing the pros and cons of different approaches. Cost is an issue that may influence medication choice in many health care systems. Medication costs are a large burden to individuals and the health systems so it is advisable before prescribing expensive medication that all other options have been considered. Cardiovascular and renal benefits of certain medications should be taken into consideration and may warrant continued use even when a person has met their A1C target. An easy approach to consider when adjusting medications is using a stop light approach (see [Figure 1](  &#x200B;    ### Medications That Create a Risk of Hypoglycemia  A risk of hypoglycemia exists with sulfonylureas, meglinitides, and exogenous insulins. When carbohydrate intake is reduced, these medications need to be reduced or stopped, with adjustment being individualized to patient circumstances. The authors recommend at least a 50% reduction in dose of insulins while stopping the sulfonylureas and meglinitides. Further reductions in insulin may be necessary according to the blood glucose response. There may be a period of short term hyperglycemia while the individual adapts to a lower carbohydrate intake; this is preferable to the risk of hypoglycemia from not reducing doses. These patients benefit from reducing hyperinsulinemia as this is thought to contribute to many of the metabolic and other abnormalities seen in type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia can contribute to increased hunger, making it more difficult to lose weight ([25](  #### Sulfonylureas and Meglitinides  The absence of long-term health benefits of these drugs provides reassurance that stopping them will not adversely affect long term health. Sulfonylureas as second line drugs may increase risk of myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and severe hypoglycemia especially in the elderly, compared with remaining on metformin monotherapy ([26]( Glucose variability and glucose spikes may also be associated with increased cardiovascular risk ([27]( [28](  #### Insulins  Unless embarking on an 800 kcal/day very low calorie and low carbohydrate diet similar to DiRECT, practical expertise suggests a 50% reduction of total daily insulin dose at initiation of the LCD is appropriate in most cases. In individuals whose HbA1c is markedly elevated, a smaller reduction (e.g., of 30%) may be appropriate, with further reductions over time. In individuals on a basal bolus regimen, it is advised to preferentially reduce or stop bolus insulin. As glucose levels improve, basal insulin can then be reduced. Mixed insulin should be stopped and switched to basal insulin alone and the daily dose can be reduced by 30–50% at the start of LCD. If on a single dose of long-acting insulin with a peak, the preferred timing is to administer in the morning to coincide with higher insulin levels with normal circadian physiology of daytime feeding and a reduction of circulating insulin with a nighttime fast. Many basal insulins do not have a high peak especially with reduced doses, allowing it to be administered at any time of day. Some patients can expect to eliminate the need for insulin completely, over days or months, as insulin resistance resolves.  It should be cautioned that some people diagnosed with T2D may in fact have an insulin deficiency form of diabetes, such as Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) or Maturity Onset Diabetes of Youth (MODY). These patients should not have their insulin stopped completely. Endogenous insulin insufficiency is more likely in patients who were not overweight at diagnosis of diabetes or required insulin earlier in their course of diagnosis ([29]( They are also likely to be more insulin sensitive, requiring smaller insulin doses than typically used in T2D. Over-reduction in insulin dosage in these patients would lead to significant hyperglycemia, and further dosage reduction should be avoided. It is recommended that expert advice and additional testing such as c-peptide and GAD antibodies is sought in cases of doubt.  ### Medications That Increase Ketoacidosis Risk  #### SGLT2 Inhibitors  These medications carry a risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis. A LCD alone cannot cause ketoacidosis, but it may enhance the risk posed by SGLT2i's by lowering insulin levels because insulin inhibits ketone formation. SGLT2i-induced ketoacidosis may occur with normal blood glucose levels, and this heightens the risk of ketoacidosis going unrecognized. It is worth noting that a very low carbohydrate diet (typically <50 g of carbohydrate a day) can produce a physiologically normal state of ketosis, that should not be confused with the pathological state of diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite recent literature supporting slight cardiovascular risk reduction and renal protection of SGLT2i's, it is recommended that SGLT2i's are used with caution in those adhering to a low carbohydrate eating plan. It is appropriate to stop SGLT2i's in many cases, particularly in those adhering a very low carbohydrate diet (30–50 g/day). A GLP-1 agonist is a safer choice as a second-line agent after metformin. An excellent review of the physiology of a LCD mimicking many effects of SGLT2i was recently pubished by Murray et al. ([30](  ### Medications With Minimal Risk but Little to No Benefit  #### Thiazolidinediones  These agents are safe to continue from a short-term perspective as they do not cause hypoglycemia. Concerns exist over their long-term safety, including risks of bladder cancer ([31]( heart failure ([32]( and reduced bone mineral density ([33]( It is recommended to stop thiazolidinediones as soon as glucose levels allow. Thiazolidinediones are also know to cause weight gain ([34](  #### Acarbose  Although acarbose is safe to continue whileon commencing on a LCD, the benefits are much less pronounced because of reduced starch ingestion so the patient can usually stop the medication.  ### Medications That Pose No Excess Risk With a LCD and May Have Benefit  ***Metformin*** is safe to continue and in some patients continues to offer favorable benefits. There is no hypoglycemia associated with metformin and neutral or minor weight loss. However, up to 25% of people experience gastrointestinal side effects from metformin ([35](  ***GLP-1 agonists***: Safe to continue. Benefits with a LCD include increased satiety and slowed gastric emptying ([36]( and cardiovascular benefits ([37]( With a sustained LCD, people may be able to stop their GLP-1 agonist. However, guidelines encourage continued use for those with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk independent of A1C. For a detailed review of the multiple mechanisms of this class of medications refer to the full review from Drucker ([38](  ***DPP4 inhibitors*** are less potent than GLP-1 agonists but safe to continue as they do not cause hypoglycemia and are weight neutral. Clinical experience from the International group of authors agreed these seem to have little blood glucose lowering effect in the context of a LCD.  A summary of medication adjustments for diabetes can be found in [Table 3]( [Appendix 1]( is a list of current published clinical guidelines on LCD with medication reduction suggestions.  &#x200B;    ### Individualization of Therapy and the Role of Blood Glucose Monitoring  For those individuals who wish to adopt a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet (<50 grams of carbohydrate/day), a significant reduction or complete discontinuation of insulin may be required. Self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be very helpful in providing rapid feedback on how foods affect blood glucose as a person adopts a LCD, and to inform whether medication doses can be reduced further. There is evidence that frequent paired glucose testing is effective in supporting appropriate food choices, regardless of the type of diabetes treatment ([39]( [40]( Patients on drugs that increase the risk hypoglycemia should have access to rescue therapies (glucose tablets/gel or glucagon), an adequate supply of testing strips, and immediate access to a member of the health care team. This is especially important at the initiation of carbohydrate reduction. Checking blood glucose for the purpose of feedback and behavior change can be extremely effective ([41](  It can be highly educational for patients to see their own glycemic response to food correlated to how they feel. This is now possible with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and has recently become more accessible and affordable with improved CGM technology. Such systems can show the large post-meal glucose spikes and increased glucose variability that are common in patients who have a standard high carbohydrate dietary patterns, are insulin-resistant, and in later stage T2D with beta cell insufficiency. The CGM can also show the impact of a LCD on reducing glucose spikes after meals ([41]( [42](  ### Anti-hypertensive Medication Adjustment  It is important to review the medication list for anti-hypertensives. Blood pressure will need to be monitored either at home or in the clinic during initiation of the dietary intervention. Patients should be shown how to self-monitor blood pressure and be made aware of symptoms of low blood pressure, such as light-headedness upon standing or severe fatigue. These symptoms and/or systolic blood pressure below 120 should prompt reduction of anti-hypertensive medication. Hyponatremia may be exacerbated by SGLT2is, thiazides, or loop diuretics. The initiation of the diet is associated with diuresis and natriuesis; therefore, adequate sodium intake is emphasized to prevent dehydration and hypotension. From a recent review in J Hypertension, they stated that from “Our analysis suggests that insulin plays a primary role in hypertension, highlighting the tight link between essential hypertension and diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome” ([43](  Boullion or broth with sodium is a good remedy as well as preventive measure in the initiation phase of the diet. Some patients with heart failure are salt sensitive so monitor this subgroup closely or reduce diuretics judiciously instead of advising sodium rich broths or foods. Tailor any reduction in anti-hypertensives to the patient's co-mordidities. Results of Dr David Unwin's 6 year observational trial showed a 10.9 mmHG reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.3 mmHG diastolic blood pressure reduction despite a 20% reduction in anti-hypertension medication ([44](  ### Other Medications Needing Adjustment  If there is a significant change in intake of leafy greens or other foods containing vitamin K, vitamin K antagonists (i.e., warfarin) will need frequent monitoring. Improvements in heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease) may allow reduction or elimination of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers. Diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome may also improve with more bioavailable food containing essential proteins and fats. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may see an improvement in their condition with a return of fertility so advice on contraception may be required. Migraines and inflammatory joint pains also may improve and require medication adjustment. Due to the natural diuresis which occurs with insulin reduction and glycogen depletion, if loop diuretics are given for edema these can be safely reduced or removed as the edema is monitored.  ### Other Lifestyle Interventions to Affect Insulin Resistance and Aid in Medication Reduction  Physical activity of all forms can assist insulin sensitivity. This can be just the general movement of walking and having an active day, to directed aerobic type activity, as well as high intensity activity and strength training. Adequate sleep, reducing stress, emerging data on the microbiome, time restricted eating, Vitamin D status, genetics, and multiple other modulators of insulin resistance and sensitivity are now being discovered and individually tailored by clinicians and patients. Discussion of these topics is beyond the scope of this paper.  ## Discussion  The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. A recent qualitative review reports medication reduction to be a primary reason for patients to start a LCD, even more important than weight loss ([45]( Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to acheve safe and effective care.

Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance above, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure responses regularly, and open access communication with the team.

This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice. Traditional medical training and clinical practice for chronic disease has long revolved around the teaching of intensifying therapy and evidenced based prescribing, a crucial skill when chronic disease progresses. Now that we are witnessing remission of Type 2 Diabetes through nutritional interventions specifically low carbohydrate diets (LCD) we must apply the same effort and thought to de-prescribing as the underlying metabolic condition improves. There is minimal guidance in the literature on how to actively de-prescribe. The American Diabetes Association in their *Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes–2021* acknowledges low carbohydrate nutritional therapy (LCD) as a viable option in the management of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Thus, the goal of our paper is to help close the gap between the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of T2D medications to the practical application and teamwork needed to facilitate safe medication reduction in the primary care setting when applied to a LCD. The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to achieve safe and effective care. The most immediate and important adjustments are to insulin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, blood pressure medications and diuretics. Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycaemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure data responses regularly, and open access communication with the team. The article is an international consensus document on de-prescribing that was put together by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians.  ## Introduction  Healthcare professionals in the primary care setting need to be competent to safely adapt diabetes medications when patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) alter their diet. Safe prescribing practice is supported through an understanding of the clinical evidence, basic science, and pharmacology of medications. This review article supports clinicians in the practical application of this knowledge to achieve safe practice.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) in their *Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2021* recognize low carbohydrate nutritional therapy as a viable option for the management of T2D. The publication states “For people with type 2 diabetes, low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate eating patterns, in particular, have been found to reduce HemoglobinA1C (HbA1c) and the need for antihyperglycemic medications” ([1]( In addition the *Nutrition Therapy for Adults with Diabetes or Prediabetes: A Consensus Report 2019* states: “Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences. For individuals with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets or for whom reducing glucose-lowering drugs is a priority, reducing overall carbohydrate intake with a low- or very-low-carbohydrate eating pattern is a viable option” ([2]( The report adds, “Use of organization-approved protocols for insulin and other glucose-lowering medications can help reduce therapeutic inertia and/or reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia” ([2]( Furthermore, the 2019 report states “Low-carbohydrate eating patterns, especially very low-carbohydrate (VLC) eating patterns, have been shown to reduce A1C and the need for antihyperglycemic medications. These eating patterns are among the most studied eating patterns for type 2 diabetes” ([2]( The ADA publications are mirrored internationally by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) ([3]( and Diabetes Canada ([4](  Clinical experience finds that a low carbohydrate diet (LCD) can be effective for all forms of diabetes mellitus, including T2D, and those characterized by a low insulin state such as Type 1 Diabetes ([5]( This review will only discuss medication adaptation for T2D. It should be noted that rapid physiologic changes can be expected and close monitoring with timely communication of glucose and medication management is essential to ensure patient safety and optimial efficacy. Potential harms include hypoglycemia due to insulins, and insulin secretagogues, and ketoacidosis due to SGLT2 inhibitors. Equally it is important to consider that carbohydrate restriction should be tailored to the specific needs and health goals of the person living with diabetes.  There is a growing body of published literature discussing the clinical application of a LCD for T2D. Virta Health's report on their novel digitally-monitored continuous care intervention at 2 years demonstrated sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health while utilizing less medication ([6]( In a primary care setting in United Kingdom, Dr. David Unwin published his patient data over 6 years ([7]( The findings from Unwin et al. include: (1) For those choosing a lower carbohydrate dietary approach for an average of 23 months it is possible to achieve a 46% drug-free T2D remission rate in UK primary care while also achieving significant improvements in weight, blood pressure and lipid profiles; (2) in patients with prediabetes, a LCD approach reduced HbA1c to within a non-diabetes threshold in 93% of patients; (3) participants who started with the highest HbA1c saw the greatest improvements in glycemic control ([7]( These clinical findings of a LCD compare favorably to historical usual care for T2D. The usual-care control arm of the DiRECT Trial achieved <2% achieved A1C <6.5% ([8](  Achieving tight glycemic targets is important for preventing microvascular complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. However, modern treatment of T2DM using pharmacological approaches does not consistently achieve HbA1c targets. Higher HbA1c is associated with more diabetes complications, morbidity, and mortality ([9]( Lowering HbA1C alone does not always reduce complications. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial demonstrated that intensive medical treatment carries an increased risk of all-cause mortality, a 35% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, and a greater risk of hypoglycemic events and weight gain of 10 kg compared to those on standard insulin therapy ([10]( Other multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled trials that used medications to achieve tight glycemic targets did not demonstrate the expected reductions in heart disease or in overall mortality ([11]( There is strong evidence for an alternative approach to treating people with T2DM.  Despite the acceptance of reducing carbohydrates as a powerful option in the T2D management there is still a certain amount of clinical inertia and a large gap between the awareness of the benefits of this intervention and the practical application. Even in the recent 63 page publication in the Lancet from the Lancet Commission on Diabetes that embodies 4 years of extensive work to make recommendations to improve clinical practice, carbohydrates are only mentioned once and only in relation to adjusting insulin doses ([17](  ## The Low Carbohydrate Diet in Type 2 Diabetes  Dietary carbohydrate restriction and LCD has lacked a consistent definition and has been used to refer to carbohydrate intake levels that are low only in relation to population averages, often measured as a percentage of kcals, but do not reach the therapeutic levels of restriction necessary to address insulin resistance and T2D. In some reported studies, a LCD has included up to 45% of daily calories from carbohydrates. For an individual consuming 2,500 calories a day this would be 280 g of carbohydrates. A LCD by some definitions comprises <130 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day which is <50% of the average daily intake in the UK and US. Reduction to levels below 50 grams of digestible carbohydrates a day are often needed to fully address insulin resistance and promote T2D remission. Digestible carbohydrate is defined as simple sugars and complex carbohydrates such as starch, which is digested to glucose; this is in contrast to fiber, which is a carbohydrate that is not digested or is only partly digested with the aid of intestinal bacteria. Recommended food choices on a lower carbohydrate meal plan include (1) non-starchy vegetables, (2) protein-containing foods such as fish, meat, poultry, and eggs, (3) natural fats such as olive oil and butter and (4) foods that naturally contain fats, fiber, and/or protein such as nuts, olives, and avocado. Sugar and refined, starchy carbohydrates are eliminated or greatly reduced.  ### Defining Therapeutic Carbohydrate Reduction and Low Carbohydrate Diets (LCD)  There are many ways to implement dietary carbohydrate reduction. The following represents some proposed definitions that represent the variety of therapeutic approaches including in carbohydrate reduction. These are based on protocols currently in use and on definitions found in the literature ([18](  VLCK (very low-carbohydrate ketogenic) meal plan recommend 30 g or less of dietary carbohydrate per day without restriction of kilocalorie (kcal). Instead, VLCK and LCK diets rely upon satiety to guide caloric needs.  LCK (low-carbohydrate ketogenic) meal plans recommend 30–50 g of dietary carbohydrate per day without restriction of kcals. Sometimes “net carbs” (calculated by total carbohydrate minus fiber) will be used with a goal of 25–30 g net carbs/day.  RC (reduced-carbohydrate) meal plans recommend at least 50 g, but <130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day, a level that is higher than therapeutic levels listed above and lower than the U.S. Institute of Medicine dietary reference intake (DRI) for carbohydrate. Restriction of kcals may or may not be recommended at this level.  MCCR (moderate-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted) meal plans recommend more than 130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day with a range of 45–65% of daily kcals coming from carbohydrate ([18]( In most cases, kcals are also restricted to maintain energy balance or to or promote weight loss. This dietary intervention reflects the amount of dietary carbohydrate typically found in the “*carbohydrate counting” dietary intervention that is given to many people with T2DM*.  This article follows common practice in using the term “low-carbohydrate diet” or LCD to refer to a variety of carbohydrate-reduction therapies implemented in clinical settings that fall below 130 g of dietary carbohydrate per day. However, the specific protocol under discussion here is a LCK diet. Clinicians should note that other interventions for remission of T2DM, such as very low-calorie diets or intermittent fasting, effectively reduce carbohydrate intake as part of overall kcal reduction. Conversely, reducing carbohydrate intake in practice often serves to reduce overall kcal. Recommendations for kcal restriction or “calorie counting” are not typically part of VLCK and LCK clinical interventions, but may be used in research protocols.  Immediate diabetes and even blood pressure medication reduction or elimination is standard care in patients undergoing gastric bypass. The practice is similar in patients undergoing a very low calorie low carbohydrate protocol. An example of this was in the DiRECT trial that required: “All oral antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs to be discontinued on day 1 of the weight management programme, with standard protocols for drug reintroduction under national clinical guidelines, if indicated by regular monitoring of blood glucose and blood pressure. The clinical emphasis must be on glucose and blood pressure monitoring especially in the first weeks” ([8](  Other examples of studies are listed in [Table 1]( that provide some guidance on the medication adjustments and frequency of monitoring for diabetes and antihypertension medications.  &#x200B;  [Table 1](  ## Categories of Drugs Used in T2DM Patients-Specific Medications and Mechanisms  A brief summary of various agents used for diabetes and their mechanisms and adverse effects are provided below ([1]( [3]( [4](  1. **Biguanides**–Metformin is the only drug in this class. Metformin reduces liver glucose output and slightly lowers insulin resistance in muscles and adipose tissue, and can decrease intestinal glucose uptake. Advere effects can include gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, vitamin B12 deficiency, worsening of neuropathic symptoms. Side effects can be mitigated with extended release preparation. Metformin has numerous beneficial pleitropic actions, the consideration of which is outside the scope of this article.  2. **Sulfonylureas** include glyburide, glibenclamide, glipizide, glimiperide, gliclazide. Sulfonylureas stimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin. Adverse effects include hypoglycemia, weight gain and potential pancreatic beta cell failure.  3. **DPP-IV inhibitors** include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin. These agents prevent the breakdown of GLP-1 hormone which lowers glucagon, increases insulin, slows gastric emptying, and reduces the appetite in a glucose dependent manner. These medications have less A1C lowering compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Infrequent adverse effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and headache.  4. **Thiazolidinediones (TZD)** include pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. These agents improve insulin resistance, but can contribute to weight gain due to insulin sensitivity in the adipose tissue. They are associated with many adverse effects such as peripheral edema, osteoporosis, heart failure as well as a risk of new primary bladder cancer.  5. **Meglitinides** include nataglinide and repaglinide. These cause the pancreas to release more insulin. Similar to sulfonylureas but with a shorter half-life, they more frequent dosing and have slightly lower risk of hypoglycemia.  6. **Alpha glucosidase inhibitors** include acarbose and miglitol. They prevent absorption of carbohydrates and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms including gas and bloating.  7. **Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)** include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin. These agents prevent the kidneys from absorbing glucose back into the bloodstream so more is excreted in the urine. They can cause euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (even in T2DM patients), genital bacterial and fungal infections, dehydration and hypotension. Several agents in this class have been shown to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease and to have cardioprotective effects.  8. **Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA)** include exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglitide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide. They increase GLP-1 which leads to a glucose dependent increase in insulin and decrease in glucagon which leads to decreased glucose including postprandial glucose. They also delay gastric emptying and enhance satiety which helps facilitate weight loss. They are more potent than DPP-4 inhibitors. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pancreatitis. They are contraindicated if a patient has a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer.  9. **Basal insulins** include insulin glargine, insulin detemir, insulin glargine U300, Degludec U100, U200, Humulin U-500, and NPH. Insulin stimulates glucose to be taken up by muscle, liver, fat cells, and brain tissue. Insulin also inhibits glucagon action so is anti-catabolic. Supra-physiologic doses in those with insulin resistance may increase hunger and contribute to weight gain. Adverse effects include hypoglycemia and lipodystrophy.  10. **Bolus insulins** include Regular, Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine, lispro-aabc, and inhaled insulin. Effects are similar to basal insulin but they are shorter acting and ware off more quickly.  11. **Amylin Mimetics** include pramlintide which is less commonly used since it requires multiple daily injections in addition to meal-time insulin. Pramlintide is a synthetic hormone that resembles human amylin, a hormone that is produced by the pancreas and released into the blood after meals where it helps the body to regulate levels of blood glucose. Amylin slows the rate at which food (including glucose) is absorbed from the intestine and reduces the production of glucose by the liver by inhibiting the action of glucagon. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia.  12. **Other agents with T2D indications**. Bromocriptine and bile acid sequestrants have also been used with some efficacy in management of T2D.  ## Diabetes Medications and a Low Carbohydrate Diet  Diabetes medications work by different mechanisms of action and vary based on their benefits and risks. This is important to consider in light of new evidence for various diabetes agents. A summary table of risks to benefits can be found in [Table 2](  &#x200B;  [Table 2](  What is most significant with diabetes medications and a LCD is that blood glucose levels typically fall rapidly and substantially when an individual adopts a LCD. It is therefore essential that medications are adjusted in order to prevent hypoglycemia. The following recommendations are based on combined clinical expertise, clinical trials, and from current published guidelines on LCD and medications.  When deciding the safety and appropriateness of T2D medications with a LCD there are three key clinical considerations:  ° Is there a risk of the drug causing hypoglycemia or other adverse events?  ° What is the degree of carbohydrate restriction?  ° Once carbohydrates are reduced, does the drug continue to provide health benefit, and if so, are the potential benefits greater than or less than the possible risks and side effects?  The preferences of the person with diabetes should be taken into account in all decisions on medication changes. Clinicians must support patients by balancing the pros and cons of different approaches. Cost is an issue that may influence medication choice in many health care systems. Medication costs are a large burden to individuals and the health systems so it is advisable before prescribing expensive medication that all other options have been considered. Cardiovascular and renal benefits of certain medications should be taken into consideration and may warrant continued use even when a person has met their A1C target. An easy approach to consider when adjusting medications is using a stop light approach (see [Figure 1](  &#x200B;    ### Medications That Create a Risk of Hypoglycemia  A risk of hypoglycemia exists with sulfonylureas, meglinitides, and exogenous insulins. When carbohydrate intake is reduced, these medications need to be reduced or stopped, with adjustment being individualized to patient circumstances. The authors recommend at least a 50% reduction in dose of insulins while stopping the sulfonylureas and meglinitides. Further reductions in insulin may be necessary according to the blood glucose response. There may be a period of short term hyperglycemia while the individual adapts to a lower carbohydrate intake; this is preferable to the risk of hypoglycemia from not reducing doses. These patients benefit from reducing hyperinsulinemia as this is thought to contribute to many of the metabolic and other abnormalities seen in type 2 diabetes. Hypoglycemia can contribute to increased hunger, making it more difficult to lose weight ([25](  #### Sulfonylureas and Meglitinides  The absence of long-term health benefits of these drugs provides reassurance that stopping them will not adversely affect long term health. Sulfonylureas as second line drugs may increase risk of myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and severe hypoglycemia especially in the elderly, compared with remaining on metformin monotherapy ([26]( Glucose variability and glucose spikes may also be associated with increased cardiovascular risk ([27]( [28](  #### Insulins  Unless embarking on an 800 kcal/day very low calorie and low carbohydrate diet similar to DiRECT, practical expertise suggests a 50% reduction of total daily insulin dose at initiation of the LCD is appropriate in most cases. In individuals whose HbA1c is markedly elevated, a smaller reduction (e.g., of 30%) may be appropriate, with further reductions over time. In individuals on a basal bolus regimen, it is advised to preferentially reduce or stop bolus insulin. As glucose levels improve, basal insulin can then be reduced. Mixed insulin should be stopped and switched to basal insulin alone and the daily dose can be reduced by 30–50% at the start of LCD. If on a single dose of long-acting insulin with a peak, the preferred timing is to administer in the morning to coincide with higher insulin levels with normal circadian physiology of daytime feeding and a reduction of circulating insulin with a nighttime fast. Many basal insulins do not have a high peak especially with reduced doses, allowing it to be administered at any time of day. Some patients can expect to eliminate the need for insulin completely, over days or months, as insulin resistance resolves.  It should be cautioned that some people diagnosed with T2D may in fact have an insulin deficiency form of diabetes, such as Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) or Maturity Onset Diabetes of Youth (MODY). These patients should not have their insulin stopped completely. Endogenous insulin insufficiency is more likely in patients who were not overweight at diagnosis of diabetes or required insulin earlier in their course of diagnosis ([29]( They are also likely to be more insulin sensitive, requiring smaller insulin doses than typically used in T2D. Over-reduction in insulin dosage in these patients would lead to significant hyperglycemia, and further dosage reduction should be avoided. It is recommended that expert advice and additional testing such as c-peptide and GAD antibodies is sought in cases of doubt.  ### Medications That Increase Ketoacidosis Risk  #### SGLT2 Inhibitors  These medications carry a risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis. A LCD alone cannot cause ketoacidosis, but it may enhance the risk posed by SGLT2i's by lowering insulin levels because insulin inhibits ketone formation. SGLT2i-induced ketoacidosis may occur with normal blood glucose levels, and this heightens the risk of ketoacidosis going unrecognized. It is worth noting that a very low carbohydrate diet (typically <50 g of carbohydrate a day) can produce a physiologically normal state of ketosis, that should not be confused with the pathological state of diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite recent literature supporting slight cardiovascular risk reduction and renal protection of SGLT2i's, it is recommended that SGLT2i's are used with caution in those adhering to a low carbohydrate eating plan. It is appropriate to stop SGLT2i's in many cases, particularly in those adhering a very low carbohydrate diet (30–50 g/day). A GLP-1 agonist is a safer choice as a second-line agent after metformin. An excellent review of the physiology of a LCD mimicking many effects of SGLT2i was recently pubished by Murray et al. ([30](  ### Medications With Minimal Risk but Little to No Benefit  #### Thiazolidinediones  These agents are safe to continue from a short-term perspective as they do not cause hypoglycemia. Concerns exist over their long-term safety, including risks of bladder cancer ([31]( heart failure ([32]( and reduced bone mineral density ([33]( It is recommended to stop thiazolidinediones as soon as glucose levels allow. Thiazolidinediones are also know to cause weight gain ([34](  #### Acarbose  Although acarbose is safe to continue whileon commencing on a LCD, the benefits are much less pronounced because of reduced starch ingestion so the patient can usually stop the medication.  ### Medications That Pose No Excess Risk With a LCD and May Have Benefit  ***Metformin*** is safe to continue and in some patients continues to offer favorable benefits. There is no hypoglycemia associated with metformin and neutral or minor weight loss. However, up to 25% of people experience gastrointestinal side effects from metformin ([35](  ***GLP-1 agonists***: Safe to continue. Benefits with a LCD include increased satiety and slowed gastric emptying ([36]( and cardiovascular benefits ([37]( With a sustained LCD, people may be able to stop their GLP-1 agonist. However, guidelines encourage continued use for those with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk independent of A1C. For a detailed review of the multiple mechanisms of this class of medications refer to the full review from Drucker ([38](  ***DPP4 inhibitors*** are less potent than GLP-1 agonists but safe to continue as they do not cause hypoglycemia and are weight neutral. Clinical experience from the International group of authors agreed these seem to have little blood glucose lowering effect in the context of a LCD.  A summary of medication adjustments for diabetes can be found in [Table 3]( [Appendix 1]( is a list of current published clinical guidelines on LCD with medication reduction suggestions.  &#x200B;    ### Individualization of Therapy and the Role of Blood Glucose Monitoring  For those individuals who wish to adopt a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet (<50 grams of carbohydrate/day), a significant reduction or complete discontinuation of insulin may be required. Self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be very helpful in providing rapid feedback on how foods affect blood glucose as a person adopts a LCD, and to inform whether medication doses can be reduced further. There is evidence that frequent paired glucose testing is effective in supporting appropriate food choices, regardless of the type of diabetes treatment ([39]( [40]( Patients on drugs that increase the risk hypoglycemia should have access to rescue therapies (glucose tablets/gel or glucagon), an adequate supply of testing strips, and immediate access to a member of the health care team. This is especially important at the initiation of carbohydrate reduction. Checking blood glucose for the purpose of feedback and behavior change can be extremely effective ([41](  It can be highly educational for patients to see their own glycemic response to food correlated to how they feel. This is now possible with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and has recently become more accessible and affordable with improved CGM technology. Such systems can show the large post-meal glucose spikes and increased glucose variability that are common in patients who have a standard high carbohydrate dietary patterns, are insulin-resistant, and in later stage T2D with beta cell insufficiency. The CGM can also show the impact of a LCD on reducing glucose spikes after meals ([41]( [42](  ### Anti-hypertensive Medication Adjustment  It is important to review the medication list for anti-hypertensives. Blood pressure will need to be monitored either at home or in the clinic during initiation of the dietary intervention. Patients should be shown how to self-monitor blood pressure and be made aware of symptoms of low blood pressure, such as light-headedness upon standing or severe fatigue. These symptoms and/or systolic blood pressure below 120 should prompt reduction of anti-hypertensive medication. Hyponatremia may be exacerbated by SGLT2is, thiazides, or loop diuretics. The initiation of the diet is associated with diuresis and natriuesis; therefore, adequate sodium intake is emphasized to prevent dehydration and hypotension. From a recent review in J Hypertension, they stated that from “Our analysis suggests that insulin plays a primary role in hypertension, highlighting the tight link between essential hypertension and diseases associated with the metabolic syndrome” ([43](  Boullion or broth with sodium is a good remedy as well as preventive measure in the initiation phase of the diet. Some patients with heart failure are salt sensitive so monitor this subgroup closely or reduce diuretics judiciously instead of advising sodium rich broths or foods. Tailor any reduction in anti-hypertensives to the patient's co-mordidities. Results of Dr David Unwin's 6 year observational trial showed a 10.9 mmHG reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.3 mmHG diastolic blood pressure reduction despite a 20% reduction in anti-hypertension medication ([44](  ### Other Medications Needing Adjustment  If there is a significant change in intake of leafy greens or other foods containing vitamin K, vitamin K antagonists (i.e., warfarin) will need frequent monitoring. Improvements in heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease) may allow reduction or elimination of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers. Diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome may also improve with more bioavailable food containing essential proteins and fats. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may see an improvement in their condition with a return of fertility so advice on contraception may be required. Migraines and inflammatory joint pains also may improve and require medication adjustment. Due to the natural diuresis which occurs with insulin reduction and glycogen depletion, if loop diuretics are given for edema these can be safely reduced or removed as the edema is monitored.  ### Other Lifestyle Interventions to Affect Insulin Resistance and Aid in Medication Reduction  Physical activity of all forms can assist insulin sensitivity. This can be just the general movement of walking and having an active day, to directed aerobic type activity, as well as high intensity activity and strength training. Adequate sleep, reducing stress, emerging data on the microbiome, time restricted eating, Vitamin D status, genetics, and multiple other modulators of insulin resistance and sensitivity are now being discovered and individually tailored by clinicians and patients. Discussion of these topics is beyond the scope of this paper.  ## Discussion  The LCD is an increasingly popular and effective option for managing T2D and can lead to an improvement in the condition, reduced medication burden, and contribute to significant weight loss. A recent qualitative review reports medication reduction to be a primary reason for patients to start a LCD, even more important than weight loss ([45]( Safe initiation of a LCD in patients on medications requires significant monitoring and medication adjustments to decrease and eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The health care team including clinicians in primary care, nursing, pharmacy and nutrition need to be competent in adjusting diabetes and antihypertensive medications to acheve safe and effective care. The most immediate and important adjustments are to insulin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2iss, blood pressure medications and diuretics. Interdisciplinary care teams can individualize therapy while following the guidance above, which includes monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure closely, decreasing medications that can cause hypoglycemia and hypotension, evaluating blood glucose and blood pressure responses regularly, and open access communication with the team.  Medical education and practice for decades has focused almost exclusively in prescribing and intensifying medical therapy as chronic disease progresses. Our international team of clinician authors hope for a day when medical education and practice will spend as much time, thought, and effort into safely de-prescribing medications as our patients restore health.""]"

Me:  I\'m a 44f, 5\'7, started at 233 pounds (high weight was 267.4 about 4 years ago). Goal weight 150ish.  I\'ve never gotten below 167.6 as an adult.  I have PCOS, hypothyroid, insulin resistance, and leptin resistance.  So losing weight has always been on hard mode, as I\'m kind of a worst case scenario for  weight control.  I lost 100 pounds about 4 years ago, but I had to make it the focus of my entire life, and as soon as I got distracted, I gained 65 of it back, mostly in the early months of the pandemic.  I\'m going to start out by saying if you only need to lose a few pounds or if you aren\'t already eating right and exercising, and all you need to do to lose weight is cut the soda and/or alcohol, or whatever, then Ozempic probably isn\'t going to help you and you should probably just skip reading this post.  I suspect some of the comments I got in my last post were from people who wanted a quick fix to take 20 pounds off for swimsuit season, and that isn\'t what Ozempic is.  If you don\'t have hormonal issues, like Leptin resistance, it probably won\'t help you lose weight, because there is nothing to correct.  But if you are already doing all the right things, and are chronically obese, and are always hungry, you might talk to your doctor to see if the benefits would outweight the risks for you.  I\'m not advocating it for anyone, but it has been an amazing tool for me.   Effectiveness:  I\'ve lost 42 pounds so far (about 18% of my starting weight) in 21 weeks, so right on 2 pounds per week average.  Of course, it hasn\'t been that linear.  I lost over 8 pounds the first week, and I\'ve had a few weeks I gained weight, but my average overall has been right on 2 pounds per week.  Which is fantastic.  I\'m also only on .5 dose (which is the low end), so I can increase still if the effectiveness lessens.  Most people don\'t lose weight until they reach a higher dose than this, so I consider myself very lucky.  I have very little appetite the first few days after my injection, followed by a few days of what I feel like is normal appetite, followed by a day or two of progressively more hungry until it is time for my next shot.  I\'m not actually counting calories right now, just focusing on eating healthy foods.  On days I\'m not very hungry, I make sure to at least get a protein shake, a salad, some fruit, some nuts ... something nutritious a few times a day.  Small meals fill me up quickly.  I had blood work drawn a couple months ago.  My numbers weren\'t terrible to start with, but they almost all showed at least minor improvement, much of which was probably due to the weight loss as much as anything.  I\'ll get bloodwork done again next month.  Side Effects:  The first week, I mostly burped a lot.  After a few weeks, I had some GI effects (more diarrhea than constipation overall). More fiber helped with that, and it mostly went away.  I have had a bit of nausea now and then.  I have to eat less food than before or I get queasy, but so far, I haven\'t found any food I can\'t tolerate at all.  Some, especially greasy foods like pizza, I have to stick to very small portions, but I have figured out that I can have a slice, no problem.  (Considering I don\'t have a gallbladder either, I consider myself pretty lucky to be able to eat greasy foods in any quantity at all.)  But the side effects overall haven\'t been anything I couldn\'t handle.  I still feel like the benefits outweigh the risks.  Availability and costs:  This has been my biggest concern.  Over and over again, I hear of massive shortages of this medication, and how some countries can\'t even get it right now at all, and many doctors won\'t prescribe it right now to new patients due to the shortage.  So far, my pharmacy hasn\'t had any difficulty getting it, for which I am grateful.  My insurance made me pay $250 copay for the first pen, but each pen after that has only been $25.  I didn\'t end up even needing the coupon that several people helpfully mentioned in my last thread.  Other thoughts:   The hardest thing for me on this journey is that I don\'t see the weight loss. I know that is a common complaint and many people say they can only see it in photos.  But I took photos at 233, 213 and now a few days ago at 193, and I just can\'t see much of any difference even in the photos.  I\'m one of those people who loses weight from EVERYWHERE at once (ankles, shins, fingers, toes - I even lost weight inside my ear canals and ended up with a weird hearing problem temporarily a few years ago), so the 40 pound loss just looks like you let a little bit of air out of me, since it is so spread out.  I\'m down 3 pants sizes, but I just can\'t see it much, even in the photos.  I\'m really looking forward to the next 20 pounds, because I\'m at the point where I started to see the changes last time.  The biggest revelation for me in this journey has been the feeling of satiation.  Other than the day before my weekly shot, I rarely feel actually hungry these days.  I feel like I\'m cheating, because this feels like losing weight on easy mode.  Sure, there are some side effects, but they are easier to put up with than the constant gnawing hunger that came with even eating at maintenance before.  I\'m eating a lot less and feeling full instead of starving.  I also have more energy now that my brain is getting the signal from my leptin - that\'s one of the things Ozempic does is increase leptin sensitivity - so when my body says ""hey, plenty of fat down here, go ahead and burn some off"", my brain can actually hear it now.  FAQ from my last post:  1. My general PCP prescribed it.  But with the shortages right now, many doctors aren\'t prescribing it to new patients. I don\'t have advice to help you get it prescribed.  Talk to your doctor about one of the other GLP1 Agonists, or wait for the supply to increase. 2. My insurance covered it, at least after my first fill.  It is FDA approved for diabetes control.  I\'m not diabetic, but I\'ve been prediabetic more than once, and at least once, got very close to the diabetic line.  It has been a battle to stay on this side of that line.  If your insurance won\'t cover it, and your doctor thinks it could help you, possibly ask them about one of the other drugs in the same class (GLP1 Agonists).  Wegovy and I think Saxenda are FDA approved for just weight loss.  If your insurance won\'t cover it, it is prohibitively expensive.   3. Since the issues that led to my obesity are chronic (PCOS, hypothyroid, insulin resistance, leptin resistance), I expect to be on this for a while.  Possibly I will need to stay on a maintenance dose forever.  We\'ll see.  It is also possible that if I maintain a lower body weight for a while, my leptin resistance will correct, and I can go off the meds and maintain the loss.   After decades of fighting against my body to lose weight, I finally feel like my body and I are on this journey together, for the first time.  Here\'s to the next 40 pounds.', '[study] A Tour Through Google Scholar\'s Studies On Weight Loss Methods.    I wanted to share the results of a long read through Google Scholar that I took. Hi [r/loseit](  **About me**  Like 3 years ago I went on Keto and it was awesome, helping me go down from like 215 pounds to 170. I could do like five consecutive pull-ups for the first time without much effort beyond mixing up Keto Chow shakes each evening! (I love those things.)  Co-workers commented on how great I looked! Cool.  Fast forward past a year of pretty easy maintenance, whereupon my doctor puts me on Zoloft, and I gained like twenty pounds back before ditching that for Bupropion, a much friendlier antidepressant that didn’t make me constantly ravenous. But try though I might, I had trouble getting back down to 170 with Keto-- I\'m still hovering around 190.  This probably had something to do with the fact that I was living alone when I first lost the weight, and am now living with my fiancee and a number of roommates. Which makes sticking to Keto… substantially more difficult. “Hello I have prepared a delicious fruit pie”, a roommate will say, and I’ll unhinge my jaw and swallow it whole (like a python) thereby breaking ketosis. Which is a bummer.  I also have a couple of other roommates who themselves were having trouble losing weight, as was my fiancee even though she’s way more wonderful and industrious and conscientious than I am. And that inspired me to take a long, interest-fueled trip through Google Scholar, since it turns out that the efficacy of different methods of weight loss is *super* commonly-studied, and ours is a beautiful age where any internet asshole can search through unlimited carefully-indexed studies looking for incredibly specific nuggets of information. *And I am just such an asshole.*  **DISCLAIMER**  So, about me! I’m just a programmer, with no particular expertise in this or any other area. That means I am deeply unqualified to offer any kind of medical advice; my only qualification for doing anything is that I spent a bunch of time skimming online journal articles. So if you get inspired to try anything I talk about in this post, ask your doctor about it before you give it a shot or else you’ll die slowly, painfully, as your poor choices consume you from the inside out. And you will cry out ""why did you betray me, UntrustworthyBastard"" and I\'ll shrug and gesture at my username.  On to the studies! Let’s start out with  # Non-pharmacological weight loss methods  ""Non-pharmacological weight loss methods"" are diet and exercise. This has been studied a lot, and these studies vary pretty dramatically in their results for reasons I\'m not totally clear on. Probably they have a lot to do with how well the participants are made to adhere to the prescribed diet/exercise regimens.  Which is actually a core limitation of these studies! Most of these studies are intent-to-treat, which means they all include each participant in the study results *even if the participants don’t follow the diet or do anything differently.* Another way of phrasing this is that these studies measure the long-term efficacy of getting a bunch of people who want to lose weight into a room, and then telling them to go on a calorie deficit/keto diet/whatever (with accompanying pamphlets and sometimes logistical support, like buying them food), and then periodically hassling them afterward for the duration of the study.  Looked at in this light, it’s frankly impressive they were able to tease out any effect sizes at all. I would have liked a review article that broke the participants down into percentiles of weight loss-- that would give us a better idea of the range of outcomes realistically achievable-- but couldn’t find any meta-analyses that did this. Such is life.  **Diet + Exercise**  [Weight-Loss Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Weight-Loss Clinical Trials with a Minimum 1-Year Follow-Up - ScienceDirect](  > *A mean weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) was observed during the first 6 months from interventions involving a reduced-energy diet and/or weight-loss medications with weight plateaus at approximately 6 months. In studies extending to 48 months, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained with none of the groups experiencing weight regain to baseline.* ***In contrast, advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point***.  [Systematic review of long-term weight loss studies in obese adults: clinical significance and applicability to clinical practice | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](  > *Dietary/lifestyle therapy provides <5\u2009kg weight loss after 2–4\u2009y, pharmacologic therapy provides 5–10\u2009kg weight loss after 1–2\u2009y, and surgical therapy provides 25–75\u2009kg weight loss after 2–4\u2009y.*  This seems basically consistent with the previous study where over the long term diet and exercise-based interventions, for the most part, lead to 5-10 lbs of maintained weight loss.  [Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet v. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | British Journal of Nutrition | Cambridge Core](  > *[L]arge randomised clinical trials with long-term dietary interventions aiming weight loss showed that individuals under intensive lifestyle interventions lose about 4·8 kg( 2 , 38 ). Hence, the further reduction of 0·9 kg in the individuals assigned to a [very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet] would represent almost 20 % of the awaited weight loss achieved with long-term dietary interventions.*  So tl;dr: Non-calorie-restricted ketogenic diets work *marginally* better than low-fat calorie-restricted diets on average, but not by much-- Keto loses you like 12 pounds, and low-fat diets lose you like 10 pounds.  This is a larger effect size than we saw in earlier studies, which could be explainable by the study length cutoff here was 1 year whereas the earlier, more pessimistic study required like four years of followup to be included in the meta-analysis (leaving more time for weight regain).  What about exercise?  **Exercise**  [Isolated Aerobic Exercise and Weight Loss: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials - ScienceDirect](  > *Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programs of 6-12 months induce a modest reduction in weight and waist circumference in overweight and obese populations. Our results show that isolated aerobic exercise is not an effective weight loss therapy in these patients. Isolated aerobic exercise provides modest benefits to blood pressure and lipid levels and may still be an effective weight loss therapy in conjunction with diets.*  This, you’ll notice, pretty much aligns with the [r/loseit]( conventional wisdom on the topic: Exercise alone tends not to do it unless you\'re Michael Phelps, who my fiancée tells me eats multiple tubs of ice cream each day.  So far, so depressing-- everyone here knows that if you have the industriousness and conscientiousness to stay on a consistent calorie deficit, you’ll lose weight. It\'s just empirically this doesn\'t happen to the degree most of us would want. Though don’t forget the study limitations! Intent-to-treat is a harsh mistress, and the use of averages in these study results conceals a *lot* of individual variation in patient response to these diets.  Anyway, on to other, more exotic (but not *that* exotic) methods of weight loss!  # FDA-approved pharmacological interventions  Drugs!  This’ll be a pretty short list; the FDA has a very high bar for safety and efficacy for weight loss drugs, and as such has approved only 9 (?) drugs in this class for current usage, several of which are on-patent and thereby only affordable to the twelve riches members of the Saudi royal family. The FDA\'s conservative about approving these, since the history of weight loss medications includes shit like Fen-Phen (can kill you) and DNP (can make you go blind and *then* kill you; though at least this one was obvious enough that it was [banned by the FDA at around the same time the FDA got the authority to ban things](  So the FDA makes *really fucking sure* these days that there\'s nothing waiting in the weeds before approving stuff for weight loss. Oftentimes this assurance comes from jamming together drugs with a long history of safe use for other conditions (see the discussion of Contrave below), which seems sensible enough.  As for whether you’d like to take drugs for weight loss, your call-- I know a lot of people on r/loseit take pride in losing weight the natural way, and more power to them. That said, the following is the opinion of the notoriously risk-averse FDA:  > [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends pharmacotherapy for weight loss when lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise and behavioural therapy) have failed and the body mass index (BMI) is °30kg/m2 with no concomitant obesity-related risk factors, or if the BMI is °27 kg/m2 and the patient has at least one obesity-related risk factor.](  I\'m aware that this does *not* align with the [r/loseit]( conventional wisdom, which mostly has it that drugs are a dangerous crutch unsuitable for long-term use (and, by implication, short-term use). Which isn\'t always true! Lots of drugs you can basically stay on forever (such as bupropion, a popular antidepressant). The unknown risks of doing so ultimately must be weighed against the known risks inherent to obesity, which are substantial; in that way, it\'s a similar cost-benefit analysis as taking drugs for any other chronic condition. I myself will probably be on acid reflux medication until the day I die, and it\'s *super worth it*.  On that cheery note: to the drugs!  **Orlistat (Xenical)**  > [weight loss achieved was about 3% [of total body mass] greater for subjects taking orlistat than for those taking placebo.](  > [produces significant gastrointestinal side effects (oily faecal spotting, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily stools, increased defecation, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain) in 15-30% of the patients under treatment, that tend to disappear with time if the patient adheres to a low fat diet.](  Gross.  This one’s notable because almost all of the other weight loss drugs on the market do so via the mechanism of reducing appetite; this one’s an exception, in that it instead stops your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat *whereupon it comes out the other side*.  Let’s move on.  **Phentermine+Topiramate (Qsymia)**  [Clinical utility of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia™) combination for the treatment of obesity (nih.gov)](  In this trial, about 8% of patients with placebo (diet + lifestyle counseling) lost >10% of their body mass; conversely, 47% of patients in the experimental group (diet + lifestyle counseling + Qsymia) lost >10% of their body mass. Note that 1% of people in the experimental group got kidney stones, so drink your water. It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)  [Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)]( has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:  > *There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only*  > *US physicians treating obesity [...] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.*  This is verified in a different study:  [Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](  > *Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.*  And also:  [A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)](  > *Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.*  (I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)  **Phentermine Alone**  [Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library](  *> The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.*  **Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)**  [Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC](  > *Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.*  So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don\'t like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.  As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.  (Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn\'t observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually *help* cardiovascular health instead, but [Orexigen fucked up the study]( so now we\'ll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)  **Liraglutide (Saxenda)**  Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you *shit gold.* (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)  # Non-FDA-Approved Drugs  Hahahahaha you fools, do not do this  # Weight Loss Surgery  I have a truly marvelous discussion of weight loss surgery that this margin is too narrow to contain.', '[study] A Tour Through Google Scholar\'s Studies On Weight Loss Methods.

It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)  [Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)]( has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:  > *There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only*  > *US physicians treating obesity [...] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.*  This is verified in a different study:  [Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](  > *Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.*  And also:  [A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)](  > *Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.*  (I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)  **Phentermine Alone**  [Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library](  *> The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.*  **Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)**  [Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC](  > *Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.*  So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don\'t like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.  As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.  (Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn\'t observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually *help* cardiovascular health instead, but [Orexigen fucked up the study]( so now we\'ll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)  **Liraglutide (Saxenda)**  Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you *shit gold.* (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)  # Non-FDA-Approved Drugs  Hahahahaha you fools, do not do this  # Weight Loss Surgery  I have a truly marvelous discussion of weight loss surgery that this margin is too narrow to contain.']"

Current date: May 18th, 2023 (cause Reddit never gives you exact dates for some reason lol) No diet or exercise routine  I wanted to take the time to write out my experience so that others might see a different perspective. I am of Hispanic/Italian descent with all of my fat in my stomach & butt/thighs. I had a child several years ago, lost the weight, but then was hired for a very toxic job that caused me to survive on only sugary Starbucks drinks or cookies to cope. I gained all of my baby weight back, plus some more. Combined with several herniated lower discs from previous car accidents, I was in pain most days carrying around this weight.  My primary doctor was able to prescribe the drug based on weight alone per BMI & the fact I was one point away from being considered pre-diabetic. I have Cigna insurance & after she submitted a letter, the drug was approved for only 1 mg until Oct of this year.  She assured me that other patients starting at 1 mg had almost no side effects & lost tremendous weight. Trusting her, I started on a Friday in case I became ill, & ate a meal of chicken/sweet potatoes the night of.  Friday night I injected at 11 pm & immediately felt nauseated. I took Dramamine & tried to sleep off the symptoms. Overnight, I suffered from intense side effects that lasted until Tuesday. Saturday & Sunday I was unable to leave the bed from how nauseated I felt. I got up several times trying to vomit & was unsuccessful. It felt like I had so much burning pain in the center of my chest & constant backwash of vomit that kept trying to come out. I was immediately constipated as well which added pressure to my stomach. I slept for two whole days, tried to vomit every few hours, cried from the chest pain, & thought I was dying.  Monday I had to work so I pushed through. I endured days of sulfur burps that made me gag & couldn\'t drink water for days without being insanely ill. There was also this awful migraine since Friday that lasted for an entire week which I chalked up to dehydration & sugar withdrawals since I was not eating. My heart rate spiked & I was feeling out of breath when I would move. No allergy symptoms were exhibited but my body was struggling.  I tried to take Pedialyte, energy drink mixers, electrolyte mixers, etc. I did not eat at all. My husband begged to take me to Urgent Care & I kept telling myself that it would get better. By Thursday I could drink some water & have some bread.  Friday\'s 2nd dose was a reenactment of the same symptoms but less severe. I felt more human by Sunday night with tiny sips of water but still couldn\'t eat until Tuesday of the following week.  By the 3rd week, the symptoms had gotten better. My chest no longer burned, still had sulfur burps, and drank sips of water, but I still couldn\'t eat much of anything until Tuesday or Wednesday.  From April 7th until May 1st (24 days), I lost 18.9 pounds. When I saw my primary doctor, I was a little upset because she had not done the following 1) explained the side effects fully 2) offered me any type of anti-nausea medicine  She seemed apologetic & I also explained that it was also my fault for calling to inquire if my symptoms were normal or what alternatives could be given to help the progress. During the 3 weeks, I was on the 1 mg, I had read online tons of Reddit posts & determined that my body was going through extreme shock & simply did its best to cope.  After meeting with her, I promised to keep her posted if I got sick again & by the 4th injection, almost all of the symptoms were gone & I was more comfortable continuing with the regime. I go back in August 1st to recheck my weight.  As of today, from May 1st to May 18th, my weight went from 239 to 231. I only lost 8 pounds because I was able to reintroduce food back into my diet. I was hoping for more weight loss but I am also being cognitive of the fact that I needed to stay hydrated & keep protein in my body.  Things that help with nausea - I drink an Ensure High Protein drink every morning. At Lunchtime I may crave something so it would be kiwi, apple with peanut butter, or cheese & crackers. By the end of the day, I am craving more protein so I will have chicken, eggs, avocado, or chips & salsa. I try to drink water but most days I can only get about 20-32 oz per day. I try to focus on fruits & vegetables if I am able to but protein seems to be what my body craves.  My taste buds have changed which is sad. I used to love kimchi & Korean pork belly. Now it tastes almost bland & burnt. I tried to have a cupcake for a birthday & everything tasted awful. I did find that expresso tastes glorious. I never was a coffee drink so I indulged in an expresso here & there. My nausea was worse than morning sickness when I was pregnant & the Ensure High Protein drink saved me. Seriously... I highly recommend trying it. I think my body was missing out on certain vitamins so the Ensure drinks help give me enough for my body to feel okay.  Constipation has still been pretty rough. I tried Benefiber & kiwi, pears, apples, or pineapple to help move things along. I read that kiwi & pineapple help digestion & constipation so I tried to have them daily. I had to resort to a Fleet enema on weeks 3-5. I only did it once a week & it seems to help loosen things to allow for a few days of regular bowel movements. Being dehydrated probably doesn\'t help which is why I tried to find high water foods.  I post this to give others insight into a worst-case scenario. I was a little more stubborn & never went to Urgent Care but I am finally feeling normal. I took a walk the other day & felt tired but okay. I plan to start working out in June.  I am craving more food now & actually had 3 small meals yesterday. With that being said, my weight will probably slow down which makes me a little sad. I have not been under 200 lbs in years & I am feeling a little desperate enough to consider moving to 1.7 mg. I DO NOT want to move up to 1.7 mg. I am terrified & I read online that lost of people get sick again going to 1.7. I wish this was easier sometimes but I am happy to be proactive with getting my life back. I want to live a long time for my little one.  Overall, I hope this helps provide some insight.', 'Albuterol sucks. Hi there. At our pharmacy we like to carry 200 generic version your Albuterol HFA inhaler that aren\'t covered by your state Medicaid plan!! They have decided to only cover brand names like Ventolin, Proventil, and Proa... wait, that one\'s gone. And thank goodness our supplier it limiting our ability to get both of those options in. Hope your had experience getting a PS5 or Taylor Swift tickets. You\'ll have to call us at least 8 times a day to have the slightest chance of getting your hands on some sweet wheezing antidote.   When weight loss trends keep diabetics from getting their Ozempic, Trulicity and Mounjaro there needs be another driving force for the next drug to be ""on back order"". So it\'s makes sense that 80% of your demand for rescue inhalers be forced to be supplied by two brand name inhalers the represent maybe 2% of our supply.   Hey family and pediatric docs. Better find a fun way to tell hundreds of patients that you never got that PA request for a generic Albuterol HFA. Ya know, because it looked like a complete joke and you almost died laughing as you put the fax in the shredder. Or made a whimsical paper macher cat named Al.   There are other options for patients of course. While we make the longest domino chain of everybodies favorite over used asthma medicine you could load up on nebulizer solution. Nothing beats breaking out that bad boy on the go. Over time you can build things with the extras your keeping at home. Maybe make a video of your dog hoping rows of them in your hallway. It could go viral!!   And patients. 80% of you don\'t use the inhaler correctly. But it\'s not their fault. Spending 5 minutes on vitals every visit and 10 minutes waiting while nurse and doc play musical chairs is more important than nailing down that technique.  Attention insurance companies. If you want to save money hire me to literally drive to homes and teach people how to use there rescue inhaler. I guarantee we can get folks to cut their refills in half with just good old education. Say we have 5 patients a day actually succeed at this. 5 people a day x 5 days x 40 weeks because I get vacation for the other 12. Price each inhaler at $50 bucks. Yeah it works out to only $100,000 dollars . But we could argue we are saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in preventable ER/hospital visits. If it doesn\'t work out you can fire me in a couple years and I\'ll go back to using generic  inhalers as dominos.  Edit: miscalculation. $50 half the time would save $300 per person a year (if they fill monthly). And this it\'s only $300,000 saved from education. But realistically we probably would be somewhere between 50k-300k.    Albuterol sucks. Plain and simple. It\'s overuse. Having switch between brand generic sucks. And patients who need the blue top...yeah you suck.  Edit: this post sounds very abrasive. It\'s meant to be silly and dumb although it\'s mostly true. If you use Albuterol HFA that\'s cool but if you fill it every 21 days or sooner something is wrong. Please find out what and fix it for your sake. Thanks!! Lots of love.   I\'m mostly annoyed by Medicaid my area suddenly covering only brand when it\'s about to be impossible to order. Patients will suffer and indirectly all pharmacy employees will suffer because we will be fielding all the cries for help.', 'Albuterol sucks. Hi there.

This is a bit of a manifesto but I want  to talk about my personal experience with taking semaglutide because I see a lot of negativity surrounding it in the media, as well as in this sub. I’d love to hear other people’s experiences with it as well - good, bad, and neutral so we can get a wider overview. I personally take the brand name Ozempic at the .25mg dose, though other injectables like Wegovy and Mounjaro, as well as the tablets like Rybelsus all fall under the umbrella of semaglutide.   My weight loss journey started young, maybe when I was twelve or thirteen, but I’ll just talk about the two most recent ones because they’re the most interesting to compare. When I was 20, I lost 70 pounds (230>160) in 2 years by following an intensive regime of CICO, meal prep, intermittent fasting, and daily exercise. Y’all were quite proud of me at the time as I did it all the “right way”!  I was able to maintain for about a year until I began having severe symptoms no one could really explain. I ended up being diagnosed with osteoporosis, a sleep disorder, a nutritional deficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety, depression, and fibromyalgia. What followed was a six year losing battle to keep weight off while throwing the majority of my energy into managing my symptoms well enough to live in the world. I gained 100 pounds, then 20 more during the pandemic.  Last May, my birth mother died of complications of Type 2 Diabetes, and in an effort to get the best preventative diabetes treatment plan, I sought expert medical advice from a private practice endocrinologist. I was quickly diagnosed with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia - I had a *crazy high* amount of insulin in my system for someone who was not diabetic. Like, 20 times the amount of insulin I needed in my blood at all times to manage a regular amount of blood sugar. It had never been caught because hilariously, my blood sugar is always perfect as well as my A1C, but it would eventually cause an unmanageable combination of type I & type II diabetes by shutting down my pancreas and making my body unresponsive to insulin. We can’t be sure what caused this, but it’s likely a combination of genetic factors and prenatal exposure to uncontrolled diabetes. Either way, I started treatment immediately.   I took Metformin for the first year. Lost 30 pounds with small changes to my routine and also literally cured most of my issues (except the spinal fractures lol). I plateaued in March so my endo suggested taking things to the next level with Ozempic. Metformin did a lot for me but she is right, semaglutide has stepped things up. I already felt better but now I can confidently say that I feel awake, alert, and relatively pain free for the first time since my early teens. I also don’t feel a constant, gnawing starvation pain that I must overcome - a feeling I used to think of as just “regular hunger” because it was all I knew.   The lifestyle changes I consciously followed while on Metformin have become intuitive. For instance, it is pleasant to exercise every other day when you’re muscles can efficiently convert blood sugars into useful ATPs - it doesn’t cause me pain and I recover quickly! It also also easier to do just about every single thing when you’re not constantly hurting and falling asleep. For example, I can almost always muster the energy to cook for myself. On top of it all, I am no longer contending with all of that insulin in my blood screaming desperately for more sugar 24/7. The mental quietude is astonishing and instead of fighting with my cravings, I can put that energy elsewhere.   So yeah. I haven’t lost much yet, maybe three pounds a month? But I feel normal, possibly for the first time in my entire life. I’m also probably not going to develop diabetes now, which means it won’t kill me in my 50’s, like it did to my birth mother. In general, I don’t really care what others think of me but I worry people will keep away from this medication because of the stigma. There are a legitimate number of reasons not to take it. To name a few: it is expensive, it’s a shot, it’s possibly lifelong, some of the side effects people experience are harsh… But it is not “cheating”. It is not “the easy way out”. It is not “just an appetite suppressant” or otherwise somehow symbolic of your moral failures as a fat person. It’s a medication that treats a disorder and like all medications your doctor may suggest, it is a tool.   Questions, concerns, comment?

6,6,622,6_coupon_pa_card_mounjaro,"7: coupon, pa, card","['coupon', 'pa', 'card', 'mounjaro', 'savings']","[""What we learned about Mounjaro from Eli Lilly's Q1 2023 Earnings Call.  Q1 2023 Eli Lilly and Co Earnings Call - April 27  * Lilly's quarterly sales of Mounjaro surpassed Wall Street's estimates, amounting to $568.5 million. * Lilly announced positive results from a new trial as a weight-loss treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The company plans to aggressively promote and offer the product in both type 2 diabetes and obesity markets.  * Lilly plans to seek FDA approval of the drug as a weight-loss treatment in the coming weeks. They expect to get a priority review and receive approval by the end of the year. * Lilly has not started negotiations with PBMs to secure coverage for the drug as an obesity treatment. * 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes have access to the drug through commercial insurers or Part D—up from about 50% last quarter. * Paid TRxs for Mounjaro increased by 55% from Q1 2023 to Q4 2022 and almost 2.5x from the week before the savings card changes. Unpaid scripts are decreasing, leading to improved profitability for the company.    * Paid scripts are patients who are not supported by the $25 noncoverage savings program. * No plan to change the pricing of Mounjaro based on the dosing amount. Want people to choose the dose that works for them at the same price. * The company is experiencing supply pressure due to the high demand for its product. Management invested in expanding capacity and exploring alternative ways to fulfill the demand. The company is optimistic about the expansion but does expect some level of short-term frustration.  From a big-picture perspective, I thought this was a very interesting exchange between an investment analyst and Lilly's CEO:  >**Evan David Seigerman BMO Capital Markets Equity Research – MD & Senior BioPharma Research Analyst**   >   >First off, congrats on the great data today. Very exciting for patients. Just taking a step back, I'd love to get some color as to how Lilly plans to balance the commercial potential of Mounjaro in both diabetes and obesity with estimates that really could best the top-selling pharmaceutical products now without overstressing the U.S. health care system, especially essentially balancing volume and cost to the system.   >   >*(I skipped the first answer as it wasn't super relevant)*   **David A. Ricks Eli Lilly and Company – Chairman, CEO & President**   >   >Yes. Maybe just to add, I think the latest data from the Medicare Trust is that we're spending about $1 trillion a year as a country on obesity-related complications and comorbidities. I don't think we always do a very good job of thinking about buying pharmaceuticals as an investment and future savings in our health. Maybe we do better when it's acute like COVID. I think we spent tens of billions on COVID therapies and didn't question it as much.   >   >I think even in the most rosy forecast, we're not going to sell $1 trillion of obesity drugs. So the question is more like, over time, can we demonstrate that treatment today reduces cost downstream? We're highly confident that, that will be a multiple of 5x, 10x savings for whatever people invest in the medicines. We have to prove that. That's our job as an innovative company is to do the outcome studies that demonstrate that. I think our competitors are doing the same thing, and that will be good for the field.   >   >And as I've said before, it's hard to imagine by the end of this decade that everyone doesn't just accept that pharmacologic treatment for overweight and obesity should be the standard of care, and it will save this health care system trillions of dollars over time. So that's our position and we need to fight for that position. We also need to do the work. And right now, we are talking about weight loss numbers, not outcomes. But that data is coming soon, as early as next year for tirzepatide."", ""Message from push provider. Just passing the info along that I received from my push provider.   HI everyone. I just spoke to my Mounjaro rep and wanted to give you all some updates. I know most of you know this information already, but I'm relaying it to everyone so we are all on the same page. So for those of you who are grandfathered in on the old coupon; and are still able to obtain the medication for $25, that will END June 30th. You can activate a new copay card at that point but it will be like the copay card currently, it will take off $500 off the list price bringing the cost down to $5-600/ month. That is good for 6 months only as they have a cap of $3000 annually. After that point it will go back to the original cost. They are hoping that Mounjaro will receive a weight loss diagnosis by 4th quarter this year but even if they do, realistically, it still won't be covered by many insurances. Currently, Wegovy has a weight loss diagnosis and only probably half of my patients on it are covered by insurance, despite it having this indication. Insurance companies do NOT like to cover weight loss so its an uphill battle for sure, but not impossible. Once medicare comes on board, then the other insurance companies will follow. My point is don't hold your breath for insurance to magically start covering Mounjaro any time soon. Stock issues will of course get better in June when the mass amounts of non diabetics are off this medication. If you are diabetic, The good news is BCBS just picked up this medication on their formulary so it is starting to be covered on those plans. The big hold out still is CVS Caremark. You can try to see if there are any clinical trials around ( google). There are 6 in process but I do not know if they are still enrolling. Just trying to think out of the box. There is no International availability for this medication so Canada/ Mexico not an option.  The new improved drugs that Lily are manufacturing are only in phase 2 right now so they are Years away from market so no new drug with coupons are coming any time soon. So what to do when your coupon stops working: 1) get a new coupon card and pay the reduced price at $5-600/month. OR 2) call your insurance and see if they cover anything under weight loss for the non diabetic and we can discuss our options if they have any choices there OR 3) switch to a generic but Ill warn. you this is a popular option and these pharmacies are swamped and running sometimes 6 weeks to get the medication so don't wait till the last moment here. OR 4) switch to an oral appetite suppressant this might help you maintain with diet and exercise but you won't see the major weight loss as you do now unfortunately. This medication is an absolutely amazing drug and it works well. I really hope that most of you can stay on it or find an alternative. If I hear anything new/different I will pass on the information to you as well."", 'Starting Mounjaro For Weight Loss. Welcome, and congratulations on taking the a first step towards better health. Below you’ll find some useful information that will help you navigate the process of getting your first prescription, assuming that Mounjaro is an appropriate medication for you.   &#x200B;  **Where to start**  If you’ve got medical insurance, the best place to start is your insurance plan website. Log on and find the “price a medication” function. Look up your plan pricing for Mounjaro, Wegovy, Ozempic, Saxenda and Rybelsus. All of these are good and effective medications that can be used to treat obesity, although several are not yet approved to be marketed as anti-obesity medications. Make a note if any of them are covered outright, covered with prior authorization (PA) or covered after meeting step therapy (ST) requirements. Also note which tier the drugs are listed as, as this will tell you what your cost will be if you can get the drug covered by insurance.  For any medications that have PA/ST, see if you can search for the actual criteria - often this can be found on the version of your insurance website that is for medical providers. If you can’t find it, go to Google and search “[Your specific plan name] PA criteria.”  Here’s an example of what PA requirements look like for those drugs from United Healthcare, a large commercial insurer:   [UHC PA Requirements for Mounjaro](  [UHC PA Requirements for FDA Approved Weight-Loss Medications](   Keep in mind that plans differ widely, even if you’re using the same insurance company to administer benefits:  &#x200B;  **Supporting Your Case**  Next, go to [PubMed]( and search for obesity + the other conditions you have. Download PDFs of any studies that show positive impact of GLP1 drugs and those conditions.   Start by printing out the OG study on weight-loss effectiveness in people without T2D: [Once-Weekly Tirzepatide for Obesity in Non-Diabetics]( New England Journal of Medicine.  Next, find some research that shows positive impact on your other health conditions. Let’s say you also have high blood pressure, you may want to include a study like [Hypertension Related to Obesity: Pathogenesis, Characteristics and Factors for Control]( Intl Journal of Molecular Science, as it links the two conditions and suggests that Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) can be used to treat both.  Bring everything you find with you to your doctor’s appointment. That way you can be prepared to get your doctor’s support not only for the prescription but for helping you navigate insurance coverage, because all of these medications are very expensive.   If after all of that your doctor won’t prescribe any of these medications for you, you need to decide if their reason for refusing is valid or not. If they are knowledgeable about these therapies and still believe there’s a reason these would not be appropriate for you, or even cause harm, you should probably take their advice. If, however, they are simply inexperienced, you can always seek out a specialist (likely an endocrinologist) or use a telehealth service.  &#x200B;  **Using Telehealth For Prescriptions**  These are the telehealth services most often referenced in this sub:  * [Push Health](  * [Sequence](  * [PlushCare]( * [Alpha](   There are various pros and cons to using these services, and seeing your regular doctor is almost always preferable and cheaper, but know that telehealth is also a convenient option available to you.  &#x200B;  **Paying for Mounjaro**  Lastly, after you’ve got your prescription, you’ll have to pay for it, and that’s where things get tricky.  There is currently a manufacturer’s assistance program (savings card/coupon) that can be found [here]( In order to use the savings card, you must confirm the following:  * That you are a resident of the United States or Puerto Rico who is 18 years of age or older. * That you are NOT enrolled in a federal or state government-funded prescription program. * That you have a Mounjaro prescription for Type 2 Diabetes.  Once you’ve confirmed those things, you should receive a savings card that will save you some money, depending on a few factors:  * If you have insurance, but your insurance does not cover Mounjaro, you should be able to save $575 each month, through December 2023. That will mean that your total monthly cost for the medication will be around $500. * If you have insurance, and your insurance covers ANY of the cost of Mounjaro, you should be able to save up to $150 each month, through December 2023, and you’ll pay as little as $25.  * If you don’t have insurance, you aren’t eligible to use the savings card at all.  You’ll see lots of people posting about how they were able to pick up their medication for $25 even though they don’t have insurance coverage, or T2D, but that’s because they are either using an older version of the savings card that is no longer available, or they just got lucky. We’ve seen a few people get lucky with “courtesy fills” from their insurance for 1-2 months, but it’s not sustainable to pay that little if you’re just getting started now. Your best bet is to choose a medication that you can afford, either with insurance coverage or by paying cash. That’s why this post begins with pricing the various medications in your insurance plan!   You will also see various posts about picking up 3 month fills at once - this is only applicable to those who have coverage for Mounjaro through their insurance.   &#x200B;  **Staying on Mounjaro**  Part of the reason making sure the medication is affordable for you is that it IS intended to be a long-term medication, and not one that most of us will be able to stop taking once we hit a goal weight. So far, there is very little known about what maintaining our weight with Mounjaro will look like - all we know is that there have been [studies published for similar medications]( that show that on average people regain up to 2/3 of the weight they lost when they stop taking the medication. That said, there have been quite a few people who come here to post about their own experiences with maintenance, and some have had good luck. Feel free to scroll to the top of the sub and type “maintenance” into the search bar to read those posts.']"

Also, some people are mean! :/  Anyway, here are my stats: 48F, 5\'5"", SW 180, GW 135, CW 133-134. Started October 6, reached goal weight by March 6. One month 2.5 mg, 3 months 5 mg, one month 7.5 mg, now back to 5 mg for maintenance (every 10 days past two weeks, now moving to 14 days). My coupon has consistently worked, and I hope to create a stockpile that will last me until December by the time the coupon stops working in June. If I feel I still need a maintenance dose after that I may switch to Ozempic, or the compounded tirzepatide. I was prediabetic; now I\'m not. I maintained a normal BMI for most of my life, but it was a struggle--constantly battling food noise/emotional eating tendencies, and an overall preoccupation with wanting to lose 10-15 pounds. Honestly a huge portion of my head and heart space has been taken up with diet and exercise plans, worrying about food, hating my body, hating my appetite, scheming to lose weight, etc. It\'s been exhausting. Finally, whether it was because of Covid, my changing hormones, a Lexapro side effect, or a backlash to the low carb diet I kept attempting, between 2020 and 2022 I gained 40 lbs and reached a BMI of 30 (obese). Enter Mounjaro. It worked, and now I feel FREE!  I\'ve always been an exerciser, and still am, but it\'s nothing crazy like I\'ve sometimes done in the past. Now, I walk when I can (sometimes a mile, sometimes 3-4), and I do some weights, maybe some light yoga 2-4 times a week. Lately I haven\'t been doing as much as I\'d like, but my desire to do more is totally about mental health and keeping up mobility and strength--for the first time, it has nothing to do with a desperate need to lose weight. It\'s a totally different mindset, and so much healthier, psychologically. I\'d like to get in some more dedicated yoga classes, and aim for my longer walks more days than not, simply because I feel so much happier if I can get out in nature each day (preferably alone, in the morning).  I don\'t follow a special diet. As someone who has obsessed over my weight from a young age (when my weight was just fine), I find that any sort of strict eating plan backfires and sets me up for the binge/restrict rollercoaster. So I\'m now embracing and emulating the ""intuitive eating"" philosophy that never seemed to work before. It\'s truly miraculous. I feel like I\'ve always been prone to insulin resistance even before I became overweight and prediabetic, that\'s why I\'ve always struggled with overeating/food noise, etc. Now I feel like one of those lucky people who can eat what they want and stay slim! Similar to the exercise note above, lately I\'ve been eating too much sugar, so I intend to scale back because I know too much sugar isn\'t good for me. But again, the decision is completely divorced from my weight. My weight is just where I want it to be, and has been holding steady. I feel like ""eat less sugar"" is a saner, and more achievable goal now than in the past, because it\'s truly about my health this time around, no longer mixed up with the complicated agony of body insecurity and weight obsession, and cutting back won\'t prompt a ""backlash binge"" as it used to. Fixing my biology has fixed my psychology.   I\'ve resisted the temptation to lose even more. I don\'t need to be super skinny--this is just fine. Sometimes my mind goes there--how low could I go? But I resist, because I want this to be maintainable, and set a good example for my kids (esp my teenage daughter).I\'m typically a size 6 in pants/jeans, sometimes an 8 in dresses (because, boobs, which weirdly didn\'t shrink a whole lot--did a man design this drug or what??).   My mind and heart space are freed up. This is the biggest NSV. I now get to figure out what to do with all that space! Maybe I\'ll write a novel....oh look I\'ve already started! ;)  One last thing: the food aversion definitely goes away. I\'m eating probably 1400-1500 calories a day, roughly. I often skip breakfast because I\'m not hungry. But I have no trouble eating a sandwich or whatever for lunch, and a normal dinner, whatever it is we\'re having. Sometimes a small snack. But I never overeat, and it just feels natural. No white knuckling! All thanks to MJ.  This is just my story--we\'re all different. I hope it\'s helpful to some of you. Sorry this is so long--it\'s been therapeutic to write it all down though.', 'Uncommon Dose Increase Story: 2 weeks on 15mg. Hi all,  I figured I\'d share my story as many threads on here seem to discuss some pretty gnarly side-effects.  I tried not to turn this into an AMA, but I\'m not opposed to questions.  Please allow me time to answer, and please realize that the advice I give is *not* medical advice.  Hence, the below disclaimer:  **Disclaimer:** This is my personal story.  This is not medical advice, not advice that you should seek, repeat, mimic, etc.  These determinations were made between my doctor, my pharmacist, and myself given my health history.  Please consult with your providers before any dosage change.  My story is as follows: Male, in my early thirties, 5ft 10in, 250lbs, A1C of 4.6, 4.7, and 4.6 over the ""GLP-1/GIP 5 month study"" period (and even before that), lastly, not T1D or T2D.  Somewhat active (45 minutes walk/day, no weight lifting or significant muscle weight - my weight was primarily carried in my stomach).  I worked with an amazing RD, and by December 2021, we fixed a lot of things through diet (lower bad/higher good cholesterol, lower triglycerides, A1C remained in the 4.6-4.7 range) which kept me off of a statin (and I nothing against them - I know they are effective for millions; I just personally know a few people that were injured by statin medications and my doctor gave me 3 months last September to fix things with diet).  In February, I was admittedly discouraged that despite the amazing changes I had made to my health based on bloodwork, I didn\'t budge much on the scale or in appearance.  That\'s when I learned about Wegovy/Ozempic, and decided to give it a try.  After battling with insurance due to the Wegovy shortage and discount card discontinuation, I was finally approved for Ozempic.  **First Month:** March: 0.25mg/4 weeks (Ozempic)  **Second Month:** April: 0.50mg/4 weeks (Ozempic)  **Third Month:** May: 1.0mg/4 weeks (Ozempic)  More insurance issues cropped up here.  The Independent External Review they had conducted that forced them to substitute Ozempic off-label expired and they refused to renew it; luckily, my doctor remembered I had been approved for Wegovy and was okay bumping me to 1.7mg Wegovy.  This caused a few weeks delay in dose, so I was worried, but no side-effects!  **Fourth Month:** June: 1.7mg/2 weeks (Wegovy) / 2.5mg/2 weeks (Mounjaro)  I had read about Mounjaro being more effective; the $25 savings card, and the seemingly less hassle in getting it rather than dealing with constant Prior Auth denials from my insurance.  I switched mid-month after consulting with my doctor.  -Side Effect(?) - Mounjaro: I, sadly, encountered a breakthrough COVID-infection toward the end of June and that psychologically made me a bit more hungry.  I felt I should be keeping my body extra nourished during this time, so I ate a bit more than normal.  I wouldn\'t call this a side-effect per-se, but I feel it\'s noteworthy.  **Fifth Month:** Early-July: 2.5mg/2 weeks (Mounjaro) / 5mg/2 weeks (Mounjaro)  **Six Month:** Early-August: 5mg/4 weeks (Mounjaro) / 15mg/2 weeks (Mounjaro)  When I requested my 7.5mg Mounjaro refill, my doctor re-assessed how I felt during the Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic) and Tirzepaptide (Mounjaro) titrations.  To be completely honest with everyone here, I didn\'t feel much side-effects, at any point, aside from some infrequent injection-site bleeding depending on the medication/pen.  I don\'t remember which caused auto injector caused the most pain and/or bleeding (Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro).  My hunger has always been suppressed by Adderall XR (and has been for years), so perhaps that explains my lack of hunger/nausea feelings.  I\'ve also ate a relatively healthy diet (little fried food, a lot of meal replacement shakes, etc).  He decided to bump me straight up to 15mg.  I didn\'t ask why the significant jump, but my local pharmacist had a brief chat with me about it (the jump raised flagged in her system).  She said to be a bit more cautious of side-effects the first few weeks I\'m on 15mg and consider not switching my administration day despite the medical literature.  I did my first 15mg injection on Monday, 08/22/2022 and my second 15mg injection today.  No side-effects from the first 15mg dose at all (perhaps an extra burp or two over the course of the week).  Since March, I\'ve gone down from 250lb to 215lb, so my weight loss seems to be a bit slower than others on this sub.  This is probably attributable to many factors - too many to name.  I wanted to share my story to demonstrate that everyone and their situation are unique:  * **Your doctor may, or may not, be willing to skip titration doses, and it\'s not something I\'d have ever considered had my doctor not offered it to me.

[Reposted without specific site info this time.]  I have gotten so much great info from this sub, but I wasn\'t quite ready to start experimenting with powders and waters on my own, so I decided to try one of the online options for the first month to get a feel for it. This is my experience, in case that might work for you, too:    Me: 50 yr old woman at 260lb, 5\'4"" to start. My doctor prescribed MJ, but insurance wouldn\'t cover it (no T2D diagnosis).    **1) Visit [site; there are several options]** -- a doctor is included in the cost to approve your application -- and sign up for the GLP-1/GIP starter program (that is the one you want that is Tirzepatide/Mounjaro). Prices vary. Mine was under $300 for the first month 2.5mg for 4 weeks and 5 mg for 1 week as a bridge.  I ordered on 5/2; package arrived via UPS on 5/10.  Subsequent months are auto-renew on a lot of these services unless you cancel, but it is already compounded/liquid and includes both Tirzepatide and B12 (Cyanocobalamin) in the mixture, which is helpful to maintain energy.  It came with the liquid medicine in a single small bottle, plus approx. 10 insulin (31g) syringes. You will still need alcohol prep pads. This solution needs to be refrigerated. It comes as a package from [a Florida compound pharmacy], but you cannot order directly from them. The confirmation email you get includes a visual injection instruction guide that is very helpful.  **2) Supplements (optional):** While waiting for the order to arrive, I looked around the forums and made a list of other suggested items/supplements from here. Do your own research vs. any contraindications for meds you are currently taking; always best to consult with a doctor. Here\'s the entire list of what I got:  * Alcohol prep pads, need (2) per injection: 1 to wipe top of vial before inserting needle, and 1 to wipe skin before injecting * Topical Cortizone and Bandaids for the injection site (to avoid a post-injection rash I saw mentioned); used at shot-time only * Generic less-drowsy Dramamine and famotidine (antacid tablet). I took 1/2 of the Dramamine and 1 famotidine approx. 1/2 hr before each shot, to stave off any potential nausea or acid reflux; used at shot-time only * Chewable heartburn/gas pills just in case; did not end up using * Iron; took a.m. * Vitamin C - if taking a B vitamin (such as what\'s already in the shot mixture), take it at a different time by at least a couple of hours, according to advice I read here; took a.m. since I was taking shot at p.m. * Magnesium; took at p.m. * Potassium; took at a.m. * Probiotic to help with possible digestion issues; took at p.m. * Berberine; 500mg 3x/day * 3mg melatonin every night to avoid sleep issues; took at p.m. * Added later: Beano pills; when having a particular gassy/belchy day, I took one and the symptoms subsided after about 90 mins and for the rest of the day; took as needed, only about 24 hrs after shot.  **3) Mini-dose:** I started 2.5ml injections the day it arrived, which was Wednesday 5/10, in the evening. By Monday, I was getting pretty hungry (for the first time since dose), so I mini-dosed another 1.25mg from my extra 5 mg they had given me to help carry me into the following month. (By now I had done research and had some powder coming from [overseas peptide provider often mentioned on this sub], so I knew I\'d be able to fill in anywhere I needed.)  Since reading further in the forums, I saw that someone said every 5 days is actually the ideal for this particular medication (MJ/Tirz) but most people can only get insured for 1 dose/week so they are stretching it out to 7 days but not by choice. That was my experience, and I\'ve seen others here are having the same 5th-day hunger issues, so it makes sense.  Here\'s the break-down by day:  **DAY 1:** Took it 2 hrs before my other p.m. medications, since I read that it interferes with their efficacy. Took my 1st dose, with 1/2 Dramamine and famotidine 1/2 hr before, and prophylactic Cortizone on the inject site + Bandaid afterwards. Didn\'t really feel any different re: hunger most of Thursday, nor did I have any side effects. On Thursday midday, I started feeling very dehydrated, so I upped my water, which seemed to be what I wanted instead of food or coffee, so I went with it. No other side effects.  **DAY 2:** I had normal meals and really no hunger, but you have to be sure to eat anyway. The med just helps you stop a lot sooner because you feel full more quickly, but you still have to make sure you don\'t overeat just ""because it\'s there."" You won\'t have the urge as much, if it\'s working for you. I wanted to eat some Snicker minis but it was 100% psychological, as for the first time I could tell I wasn\'t hungry/didn\'t have that empty feeling, so I avoided doing so. No side effects.  **DAY 3:** Feeling full after only a few bites at every meal. No side effects.  **DAY 4:** On this day, I started getting what people are calling ""sulfur burps"" and also gas. I took a Beano pill with lunch and it reduced the incidence of both of those significantly for the rest of the day and the next. No other side effects.  **DAY 5:** I felt colder than normal by midday, but it seemed to go away a bit later. By 6 pm, I was getting ravenous, so I went ahead and did a half-dose boost (1.25mg) from the excess that [service] had included. As before, I did half a Dramamine and a full Famotidine 1/2 hr before injection, then put Cortizone and Bandaid on afterwards. By 8 pm the total lack of food interest/ability to ignore food was back, and so was the colder-than-normal feeling; it wasn\'t terrible though. No other side effects, and coldness was gone by next day.  **DAY 6:** Woke up with zero hunger, but was pretty tired by afternoon even though I was eating (moderately) and having my usual coffee. Gas returned this evening around bed time, so it seems to be happening roughly 24 hrs after the shot every time. No other side effects.  **DAY 7:** More tired than normal, but still not really hungry (continued eating regular smaller meals). Got a little constipation, but I think the probiotics are helping in that regard.  Didn\'t really feel like I needed a dose at all to start a new week, let alone the full dose, so I skipped this one and will wait to take another half-dose at the 10th day so I can half-dose every 5 days and see how that goes. Hope this was helpful if you\'re still on the fence.  **TLDR: Lost 4 lbs. on EZ mode.

[Reposted without specific site info this time.]  I have gotten so much great info from this sub, but I wasn\'t quite ready to start experimenting with powders and waters on my own, so I decided to try one of the online options for the first month to get a feel for it.

Prices vary. Mine was under $300 for the first month 2.5mg for 4 weeks and 5 mg for 1 week as a bridge.  I ordered on 5/2; package arrived via UPS on 5/10.  Subsequent months are auto-renew on a lot of these services unless you cancel, but it is already compounded/liquid and includes both Tirzepatide and B12 (Cyanocobalamin) in the mixture, which is helpful to maintain energy.  It came with the liquid medicine in a single small bottle, plus approx. 10 insulin (31g) syringes. You will still need alcohol prep pads. This solution needs to be refrigerated. It comes as a package from [a Florida compound pharmacy], but you cannot order directly from them. The confirmation email you get includes a visual injection instruction guide that is very helpful.  **2) Supplements (optional):** While waiting for the order to arrive, I looked around the forums and made a list of other suggested items/supplements from here.

Myth No1. ""Diabetes T1 is a deficiency of Insulin"": For me this was a \'Banting and Best moment\' . In fact there are so many articles which allude to this I ask you just to scan through the many articles available online which show that islet cells produce equal amounts of insulin AND c-peptide and amylin. ALL THREE of these peptides have been shown to have independant and dependant physiological effects on a wide range of tissues by either modulating receptor sites in connective, nervous and endocrine tissue. Since 2004 (and maybe earlier...) Published studies have shown that C-peptide is an active peptide moiety released from the Islet cells as a  hormone in it\'s own right and that administration of c-peptide is shown to reverse many of the neuropathic effects of diabetes on nervous tissue. In fact ( and to my great relief) an american drug company is producing a weekly injection of a c-peptide analogue  which the FDA are \'rushing through\' phase 2 trials as the potential for this treatment is monumental. Stop and think about the significance of this.  Amylin the enigmatic third peptide is much more controversial as this peptide fragment builds up in huge amounts in Islet cells in T2 diabetes  and results in the death of these cells - the evidence is that the majority of T2s at presentation have compromised Islet cell function as a result of this - hence T1.5. In addition ALL T2s initiallly present with differrent metabolic difficulties to T1s BUT they ALL end up on insulin (if they live long enough) because amylin destroys Islet cells until the T2s then present similar metabolic problems to T1s!!!! Really?  -Yes and this should not be a great surprise. So naturally when I propose that amylin should be included in the \'holy trinity\' of peptide replacement, believe me I have thought about this a lot. Amylin has fewer studies to characterize it\'s physiological action BUT these show that it has effects to modify appetite signals. Insulin seems to promote appetite and so for T1s and T2s concerned about weight management, the addition of amylin might have unforeseen beneficial effects.  Myth No2. ""A lower HbA1c is the answer"" to managing both T1 and T2 diabetes. This is just not tru and also not bourne out in many studies that set out to show the opposite. Even the greatly heralded UKPDS trial failed to show convincing evidence of this (imo). In fact one of the conclusions was that NONE of the drugs used in type 2 to lower BP  was associated with any benefit in terms of cardiovascular mortality and that the only treatment that had a significant benefical outcome was metformin which seems to have little \'direct\' action to lower blood sugar. Interesting that metformin is a simple molecule that to my mind imitates Nterminal of peptide moities  ( I will mention this again later) which imo are important in the regulation of peptides released from endoocrine and gut tissue whereas the active sites of insulin are a 6 peptide fraction at the Cterminal end.  Myth No3 \'The Honeymoon period\' This is classically understood to be a period of time in T1 where there continues to be some insulin production. Looking at the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of insulin compared to c-peptide - they are wildly different. In the honeymoon period insulin deficiency will present first whereas c-peptide deficiency will present later (if at all). I have personally known families and individuals that buck the trend. patient confidentiality issues exist as I am a practicing physician. I think it is safe to say I can report individuals with type1 who have died from renal failure wityh neuropathy in their early 20s and 30s whose Hba1cs have been no higher than other individuals who seem to have T1 and live to an old age - I have 2 patients > 70 years old with T1 and NO COMPLICATIONS. I suspect that HbA1c and \'control\' ARE NOT as important as their c-peptide production. Cost limitations in the UK and politics mean it i not possible for me to request c-peptide levels in this type of patient but imo if I did I suspect that the younger patients entering crisis have no c-peptide or amylin and that the older surviving patients have insulin levels that are to low to be physiological whereas their c-peptide levels might still be achieving saturation levels at receptor sites hence NO COMPLICATIONS.  Myth No4 ""reduce your blood sugar with whatever drug you can find!"" . Oh dear - I have a little background knowledge here. The drugs like the Glyptans are really BAD news for T2s they do indeed lower your blood glucose BUT if you approach this problem slightly differently you should realise that these drugs are promoting the re-emergence of peptide moities concerned with metabolism whose primary role are growth factors expressed in embryos which influence gut development - unsurprising then that there seems to be some \'noise\' in the journals about oncogenes and pancreatic cancer! Yes these drugs are harmful and now I read articles that show that there is NO supporting evidence that these drugs reduce cardiovascular complications in T2s. HbA1c has become a surrogate marker in both T1 and T2 diabetes for good outcomes. What a lot of these long term follow up trials are telling us is that THEY ARE NOT. Because drug companies can measure Hba1c more easily than measuring \'is my patient with diabetes going to have a good life outcome on this drug . \', we live in peril of the next \'wonder\' treatment for diabetes and suffer the side effects. The exception has always been metformin. This drug does not primarily ifluence HbA1c BUT does affect outcomes in long term trials . Interesting that metformin is now also being recognised as having anti-cancer properties which fits with my proposal that it is a peptide regulator. Many of the peptides concerned with the bowel( the biggest endocrine gland in the body!) will have a role as oncogenes . there has been a proposal that metformin be introduced as an agent to suppress secondaries in breast cancer. It is with great relief to me that the researches in this field are waking up to a wider role for this drug and investigating how it works...  Myth No5 \'c-peptide is an assay to see if you have T1 or T2\' - No the reality is much more profound and I wish the world would see c-peptide as one of the keys to understanding complications in diabetes.  Myth No6  \'Drug companies want to help\' No - they really just want to make money. My alluding to surrogate markers is an example of this  - manufacturers have spent a lot of time purifying insulins and now they have a whole industry based on producing insulin analogues. They are not in a position to promote a different approach to looking at the pathophysiology of T1 and T2 diabetes. I am posting on here through sheer frustration that the professionals I work struggle with the tunnel vision that drug companies seem to thrive in.  In summary - I realise that I have not provided  links or references - this is because I am too disorganised and am typing this at the back of  our local sunday church service(! - him up there will understand my failings). My experience is of having T1 for over 40 years and being a physician for over 20 years. Please read this article and forgive any of the huge jumps I am making but think about this and explore my thinking carefully. Remember that Islet cells are foregut endocrine tissue that stores and releases THREE peptides whereas the world seems only interested in replacing just one of these.. Thank you for being patient with me - this is my first post on Reddit and I apologise if I lack the basic skills on here I am a head down worker in reality . I am interested in provoking thought and hopefully discussion . I hope I am not just formulating my own myths :) ', ""keeping it off. I've only really ever lost significant weight once before in my life, and it was right before I gave birth to children, and the weight didn't stay off because that is a crazy time in your life with weight.  But now I've lost over 100 lbs with a combination of keto, mounjaro (a diabetic medication similar to Ozempic) and swimming and I'm hoping to lose about 200 lbs in total.  But as I do more reading and research, it seems that keeping it off seems to be a huge challenge for people, and I'm beginning to worry about maintenance.  It seems like people who don't have weight loss surgery have a very high chance of regain.  Is it inevitable?  What are other people's experiences?

I know a lot of people are worried about the weight loss medications because you have to take them for life - well, I was already on another GLP-1 agonist (victoza) for many years before mounjaro, but it was one that didn't help with weight loss as much.  I can't tolerate metformin, I've tried many times and it makes me incredibly sick.  I do keto because I like it, I don't feel deprived or anything at all.  It also seems to be the diet my body responds to the best.  Honestly, I'm allergic to most of the yummy carbs, so keto is pretty easy for me.  I see maintenance for me as adding in carbs like more fruit and probably sweet potatoes (I'm allergic to white potatoes), but as I can't have bread, potatoes or tomatoes anyway it's not like I can go crazy for pizza or fast food.  I've never been a binge eater, I think my weight gain was mostly a combination of medical issues (thyroid and insulin resistance) and me not realizing that what I thought was a healthy diet (typical American diet with lots of carbs) wasn't doing me any favors.

I watched my own parents go up and down the diet yo yo, and the only thing that stopped the yo yo was eventually gastic bypass surgery, which left them with some pretty severe complications, though it did get the weight off.

I would also love to hear from people who did have regains and maybe what insight they could offer on what happens with regains.

I want to go to Universal Studios next spring with my kids and fit on the Harry Potter ride that I didn't fit on several years ago when I went.  I want to be happy and healthy into retirement and be able to walk all over Europe and to wrestle with my grandkids.

I\'m starting my weight loss journey with Saxenda on Sunday and I wanted to share my story with you all.  I\'m a 35 year old Female, living in Belgium and as a lot of women, been struggling with weight since puberty. I\'ve followed a lot of diets in the past, some worked, some haven\'t but in the end, they were not durable and I couldn\'t keep up with the strict rules and what not. So since my 2nd pregnancy I\'ve been seriously overweight. I\'m currently at 95kg (210lbs) and I\'m 1m72 (5′ 8″) so I have a BMI of 32.  Since last year, I\'ve discovered that i\'m HSP. I was already suspecting it, but suspicion turned into certainty. Coping with some of my HSP (for example when I get frustrated) results in binge eating and drinking alcohol. The more stressful my life is, the more I drink and lets say that at a certain point it just wasn\'t healthy anymore. I get easily stimulated and food is no exception. If you know the expression ""I love seafood. I see food and I eat it."", well... that is basically how it is for me every single day (The same with alcoholic drinks). This makes it very hard for me to restrict my food intake since the urge is higher than what my mind is really telling me.  I\'ve been reading online (yes, since the big hype about it) about mainly Ozempic and Wegovy and I felt like this might be a solution for me to get back to my desired weight. Which is between 75 - 78kg (165 - 172lbs). The last time I had this weight was 7 years ago. This has been my medical process so far:  1. First I went to my GP and did my story and asked for the Ozempic prescription. I didn\'t get it... Before she would prescribe me anything she wanted to do a full blood check and gave me the following extra options: make an appointment with an endocrinologist (if I would be prediabetic, health insurance would cover it) OR go to a dietitian OR go to a psychologist (for the drinking/bing eating part) I also had to look into Weight Watchers or something like that and advised me to lower the drinking. I chose for the endo-doc and told here I was going to lower the drinking and look into WW. 2. The day after my appointment I made the appointment with the Endo-doc and looked into Weight Watchers. I hated the point-system and the commercial selling around it while reading into it and found that counting calories would be better/cheaper for me. So I downloaded a calorie counting app. I tend to get a bit obsessive when it comes to calorie counting so years ago I banned it out of my life because of that. 3. A week later I had my blood drawn and had to wait for the results. I also told my GP that WW wasn\'t going to be something for me, but if I have to do something, I\'ll just count calories. Told her I got the app. Until today, I haven\'t used it. 4. A week later I got the results from my GP and a reference letter for the endo-doc. My blood was fine. Just a little high on the cholesterol and one of my liver-values was quite off (shocker...). 5. A week later, which was yesterday, I had my appointment with the endo-doc, did my story and he prescribed me the Saxenda. They gave me the usage instructions and showed me how to safely inject it. The doc also pushed me to get an appointment with a dietitian and I had a small talk with her also. I told her that I wasn\'t keen on it, because I actually know what the healthy and unhealthy choices are according to food. It\'s basically that I don\'t have a structure when it comes to eating and have a lot of urges which I can\'t control and I don\'t think that she can help me with that (that is what the medicine is for). In the end I gave it a chance and I agreed to 1 appointment, which is next month. Later that day I got my prescription. It costs 245 euros for 5 pens and I\'m paying it all out of my own pocket. 6. I have to take the Saxenda for 3 months and already have a follow up with the endo-doc the end of August.  Also, since my visit with the GP (3 weeks ago) i\'ve been drinking a lot less. Only in weekends and not as much as I would normally drink. So that has already been a win win for me. My partner supports me in my process and he also decided to quit drinking during the week and lower his soda consumption.  Thank you to all who has been reading till the end. I hope this might help people in a similar situation as I am.  Edit: I also wanted to share this because the road to the prescription it\'s not always as easy and fast as may seem in the stories you read online.', 'Saxenda - The first 6 weeks (rather long, kind of rambly). 6 weeks ago I attended the weight management clinic at one of the main bariatric hospitals in my area, to see if I\'d be suitable for bariatric surgery.  For a range of reasons, they said no - at least not yet - and offered to try me on Saxenda for a while.  One of my biggest issues with my weight journey has always involved my understanding of my body\'s hunger and fullness cues. They are entirely broken. I am AuDHD and my interoception  just does not function correctly at all, so finding a way to help with that issue has always been of interest to me.  I started on the standard dosing schedule, spending a week on 0.6 per dose and increasing by week until reaching the full dose of 3.0 in the 5th week. I was nervous about injecting, but the needles are so fine and the pen makes everything so easy that it\'s now become second nature to me. Wake up, go to the bathroom, come back to my bedroom, put a needle in my pen and get going. Easy peasy.  **Effects**: For me, the effects were near immediate. Even on 0.6 I found that the incessant ""chatter"" in my head about food started to die down. I still think about food, planning meals and what I want to eat, but the near obsession that I have with it started to fade almost immediately. And even at 0.6 I was finding that I was leaving food on my plate, starting to actually feel ""full"" and not wanting to proceed beyond that feeling.   I also lost the FOMO that I was accustomed to feeling whenever I would order food, be it in a grocery shop or when we got takeout. Before Saxenda, when ordering food I would be driven by ""But I crave this. And this. And this"" and it would be very difficult for me to feel fulfilled just choosing one or two things. But now I\'m finding that even my favourite foods aren\'t driving that kind of feeling now. I\'ve also found that I don\'t eat as much because ""It\'s dinner/lunch time"". I eat as and when I\'m hungry, which is nowhere near as often.  These effects have continued as I escalated the doses and are currently still occurring for me at 7 weeks.   **Routine**: I take my dose at 8:45am, or within the hour either side. On a work day that\'s just before I start work for the day, on a non-work day that\'s usually when I get up to go to the bathroom before going back to bed for a while. I find that covers me for the whole day, up through and past dinner time with no issues.  I currently do not count calories, due to some issues with my AuDHD and calorie-counting behaviours in the past. My main focus has been learning to listen to my body cues, to understand when I\'m hungry, when I\'m full, and to reduce portion sizes. For me, Saxenda is a tool to help me learn how to identify what\'s going on with my body, and the calorie reduction is naturally occurring with the reduction of intake. As I lose more weight, I know I may have to start a degree of calorie control, but for now that\'s in the longer term.  **Results**: I had my first check-in yesterday since starting back on the 27th of January. Due to the fact that I\'m severely morbidly obese (268.7kg, nearly 600lb), I don\'t have a set of household scales that I can regularly weigh myself on.  My current weight is 258kg. In six weeks I have lost 10.7kg or 23.59lb (1.68 stone). That\'s approximately 5% of my total body weight, and right on track for what was desired as a first-stage goal, so I\'m chuffed.  Because of my size, the physical effects of the weight loss are less evident. I can feel some changes, but it\'s hard to associate them with an actual, measurable loss. So finding out I\'d lost so much in this time was a very pleasant surprise.   **Side Effects**: This may be TMI, but we all know what the side effects are, so here it goes.  Some of y\'all aren\'t pooping at all, but personally I\'ve had the opposite. It\'s not constant, it comes and goes, but holy shit have I had the squirts sometimes. And it\'s not like other diarrhea where there\'s cramping and unpleasantness as a warning. Sometimes I\'ll just be in the bathroom to pee, feel a fart coming and then it\'s like... it\'s a travesty. So yeah. No trusting farts for a while for me. Though that\'s honestly been the most unpleasant side effect for me, so I\'m counting myself lucky in that regard.  I\'ve also had the sulphur burps, which is my second worst side effect. These seem to correlate the most strongly with my GERD flaring up, and being dehydrated. So when they kick off, I find upping my water and taking lansoprazole helps clear them up. They suck, and I hate them (I love eggs, and the ""eggy burps"" put me off them for a while), but they\'re definitely not the worst thing.   I also have an umbilical hernia, and my gut is a chatty bitch since I\'ve been on Saxenda. Because of the way the hernia is, any stomach/gut noises are just amplified, and my tummy will sometimes just join in the conversation. Mostly amusing more than anything else.  I am finding that if I over indulge and eat too much (driven just to finish that plate of food, or grab a few too many pieces of something) I feel bloated and gassy, and it\'s not a pleasant feeling. So the negative feedback for overeating is much more immediate than it used to be. I haven\'t eaten to the point of physical illness yet, but I\'m starting to learn where my limit is to avoid those feelings, and it\'s helped to reduce my overall portion size, or to get better about putting things aside for leftovers.   Hand in hand with that, even though I\'m not actively calorie counting, I\'m finding that I\'m less willing to eat ""Meh"" foods just because I\'m in the mood to eat, or because I\'m trying to fix boredom with sensation. This has led to less general snacking, but also it\'s led to me being a bit more mindful about what I buy to eat. Am I going to want to eat this food before it goes off? Is there something I want to eat more? Do I really want that takeout if I know it\'s going to be cold and less than appealing when it gets here?  So I\'m trying to lean into these feelings and foster them, to get value out of my food, not just from the nutrition but how generally satisfying it is.  So those are my feelings, thoughts, observations and results from my first six weeks.  Is Saxenda a miracle drug? No. I still have to be aware of what I\'m doing and what I\'m eating. It\'s certainly possible to overeat while taking it, especially if one is willing to forge through the side effects.   Has it helped me? Yes, immeasurably. I wish I\'d had access to it earlier.   I\'m planning to stay on it for now and to try to use it in conjunction with re-learning my eating habits, and developing a better relationship with food. I probably still will end up getting bariatric surgery at some stage later, but for now I\'m very happy with how things are proceeding.', ""Saxenda Journey. G'day Liraglutide Reddit.  I recently started on Saxenda, and figured I'd share my progress and as much information about the effects felt along the way to hopefully give further insight to anyone considering.  I will be following the recommended weekly incremental dosage leading up to the 3.0mg—I am currently on 1.2 and will aim to update on the weekend following the dosage increase (Thursdays) to hopefully capture any changes. I'll try and update throughout the weeks to add any points, which will be date-stamped under the appropriate week.  ***Edit: For clarity****. My normal days eating will not exceed 1400cal at most. Here is how it will usually look - All my Cals are rounded up:**Breakfast & Lunch - Overnight Oats (400-600 cal) or Protein Shake (300 Cal). Usually the overnight oats will last me all day at work with a protein shake in the afternoon. The oats are made based on the day I am anticipating.Dinner - 400-600 Cal meal scaled to how I have ate during the day. Usually consisting of Chicken, Veg and a small portion of Rice. My diet is 40% Protein, 40% Carb, 20% Fats at the current time.*  In this post, I'll talk about my experiences along the way. Exercising, Socializing/going out for meals, drinking and occasions where what I eat may not necessarily be completely within my control—and any other topics which I found useful to know, which I'll bold within the respective weeks. If you have any questions, let me know and I'll try and include it if I have any personal experience.  **A main point to stress: Everyone's journey is different, my losses or effects should never be** ***strictly*** **compared to another/your own.**  # Starting Weight: 102kg / 175cm  # Week 1: 97.5 - 0.6mg —  *One of the most common questions I found, and also had, was 'How long until you feel the effects?*'. Everyone is different! I take my dosages in the morning, around 7am and traditionally have breakfast around 9-10am (I'm a slow breaky eater, usually making an overnight oats and eating it through the morning 4-600Kcals). On the first day, my appetite started feeling reduced after a few hours, by the time I finished lunch I was feeling fuller than usual.  As the days passed, my appetite gradually reduced and my capacity to eat a 'full' meal widdled away. By day 4, I went out for a social meal and struggled to eat half a burger and consume a No-Sugar JD. Day 5 I had my first '*over-eating*' experience. Was at a social gathering and had a few snacks (3 cookies and a handful of crisps) followed by a pasta-dinner, which all came back up. Lesson: Don't eat too much in one sitting. Something I have been very conscious of since starting—Nausea/Vomiting has been pointed out to be associated with eating beyond your means while on Saxenda, and this brought it home for me.  **Exercise** has been a struggle. I am eating a reduced calorie diet due to the drug, which comes back as reduced energy levels. I am someone who runs frequently, and the first week almost threw it out the window. I was barely able to make it 1.5km without stopping due to exhaustion or the effects of GERD/Nausea (Don't worry, it gets better - I think). For comparison, I was able to run 27min 5Km the week prior, week 1 was a struggle at 34minutes. Despite this, and I recommend for everyone: **Keep Moving.** Set a goal of 7-10k steps and go for a walk. Even a 1hr walk can get you 4-6k steps, it all adds up!  A quick article on what exercise, even going for walks, does for you - It's more than just slimming down. [  # Week 2: 94.8kg -1.2mg  Eating habits have adapted a little better—Got to find what works for you! I still enjoy eating a slow breakfast of overnight oats. However it a moved to more of a 'Breakfast and Lunch' ordeal. I have dinner slightly earlier and will have some protein yoghurt before bed to avoid pre-sleep hunger which usually develops now.  *A mantra I am keeping in my mind as I go through this is:* ***This is not a miracle drug, nor is it a lifestyle.*** *It is a means to lose weight. The lifestyle changes and habits need to be coming from you! I am someone who stress/boredom eats. Use this time to correct the habits you have developed (like 3L of water a day people!). Otherwise you run the risk of regaining weight lost if you stop taking Saxenda (as I will once goals are reached). This is about finding a way to enjoy the food you love, in a healthy and responsible manner. Remember - It takes roughly 2 months to build a new habit, use your time wisely!*  **Exercise** has become progressively easier. Gym is back on, but slower and less intense. Running time has reduced from 34 to 31, with the GERD feeling significantly reduced for 5km. My current assessment is to expect a massive reduction in *capacity* for moderate to intense workouts, due to the drug and the reasons listed last week. I expect as I adapt to the drug and change my eating habits, it will become manageable—for those starting, expect a hard barrier on exercising.  Exercise is becoming easier by the end of the week, as I start 1.8mg I'm not entirely sure if that'll push me back again. Post-Run/Intense training the lack of hunger has gotten stronger. My last run finished at 1800, and I wasn't able to eat (I had a familiar foreboding feeling if I tried) until the next morning. All I can say is: Try and get a protein shake into you! Your muscles need it!  **Drink Water.** You want to be hitting 2-3L of Water a day, depending on your body type, exercise etc. Drinking water is crucial for weight loss and maintaining a healthy functioning body. Find an online calculator and see what some of them say! I hit 3L most days, and will still be thirsty (especially in the mornings). This is also highly important in managing risks and some side-effects associated with Saxenda (like Headaches, Constipation and Gallstones!).  For more drinking motivation, this link covers the benifits and how it may help you: [  One last note: Make sure you're eating a good balanced diet and your essential vitamins are being taken. As someone who doesn't bruise particularly easy, I've noticed the last few injections leaving a bruise - which I'm noting may indicate my Iron is lower since starting. Pay attention to your body!  **Update from the comments:** It was noted that the areas we're injecting could also be hitting mini veins, so be sure to rotate areas frequently and don't it the same spot twice in a short period!  # Week 3 - 93.8kg - 1.8mg  Energy levels are returning. Every week I’ve felt my overall capacity increase, compared to the first week where I was fatigued most of the time. Overall I expect to easily maintain about .6-1kg loss per weak minimum at the current caloric deficit, and hopefully week 4 results will continue to testify to that.  **Exercise**: Along with the capacity increase. I can easily maintain multiple gym sessions of varying intensity. 5km run is almost back at normal times. 10km run is also coming back down rapidly, and even starting to scratch recent PBs. My average heart rate is increased on average by about 5-10bpm, with my average heart rate going from 172-175 to 179-182 per run. I also have to control my pacing more, as pushing too hard (but not to old standards) will induce nausea (over working).  As previous, I recommend starting slow with exercise and slowly building up. I am expecting it to be a few more weeks until I’m back to where I was previously (and that wasn’t anything special). Walking is king for starting up!  Water is a pain to maintain.  # Week 4 - 92.9kg - 2.4mg  What a week. For people who are nervous about tackling social events and the effects of Saxenda, this week is for you. A wedding (which I only remember 80% of), ANZAC Day and a long awaited reunion with some friends at a Burger Bar. I've been nervous leading up to this week (enough that I almost wasnt going to start until after).  Social Events: **Know. Your. Limit.** I didn't over indulge in foods while out, on any of the occasions - avoiding the overeating sensations (nausea). I found I nursed my drinks a lot, with the exception of the wedding - Turns out I can drink wine like a boss while on Saxenda (but have probably turned myself off it now). At the Burger Bar, I shared my entrees as I consciously knew I would be incapable of eating a full one, and wanted to try multiple - Eat Smarter, not more! Though, couldn't quite finish the burger - but didn't force it. Again, the only reason I think I got through these events: **I knew my limit.**   The real test in the future once I hit my fat loss goals, will be ensuring the lessons and mindset continues. Drinking water through the day, to suppress appetite and relying on protein shakes should that not work. Healthy snacks. I relied on all these aspects this week.  **Exercise**: My new habit is to not take Saxenda before my Morning Runs. This has greatly reduced the GERD I was experiencing and am back to making positive progress. My body still certainly struggles with the reduced calorie intake however, and always finish a run with nausea.  I'm a few days into my 3.0mg dosage, and will provide one final update before reducing to a slower update cycle (key milestones, to resume when I start weaning off).""]"

Prediabetic for 6 years ranging from 5.9 to 6.7 with metformin only. A couple of years ago I was officially ""baptized"" into diabetes T2 proper, with an HBA1c of 8%, and entered a regime of Trulicity 1,5mg along with my metformin. HBA1C went back to 6,5. Thing is, this shortage seems to be lasting *for ever,* and it\'s starting to become a real stressful situation searching for trulicity in dozens of pharmacies until I find it. Moreover, Trulicity may have benefited my T2 but I haven\'t seen much of the vaunted weight loss effects. I only lost 4-5 kilos (~8 pounds for the friends across the pond) and that mainly in the barbaric, hellish phase of first getting accustomed to the drug (and what a fresh hell that was)  I\'m currently thinking of abandoning trulicity for an sglt2 med (farxiga, jardiance, something like that). It\'s simply too much stress to wonder whether you\'ll be left with no treatment in this never ending shortage. To me, it\'s become a liability and an untrustworthy course of treatment, when you can\'t be sure it will be available next month. The fact that the damn thing needs to be put into the fridge, and is a pain in the ass to carry with you on vacations, trips, etc, does not endear me either, particularly when I might have to go miles at a time to find it.  My questions.  a. Will i have to go over the initial barbaric symptoms of starting a glp-1 agonist all over again, if I ever switch back to trulicity whenever the shortage is over? Does the treatment work less well if it is stopped for some months/years and then restarted?  b. Does anyone here have any experience with switching from GLP-1 agonists to SGLT2 class diabetes meds? Were those experiences positive or negative?  Thank you everybody.', 'Is this normal?. Hi guys! I don’t normally post on Reddit so I hope I’m posting this correctly.  So, I’ve had type 2 for years now and haven’t always taken care of it. I started out taking Metformin and it gave me the worst stomach aches/diarrhea and asked to switch to something else. My DR prescribed me an injectable called Trulicity which worked great for stabilizing my sugar but constantly made me nauseous and I’d be throwing up constantly. I tried to stick with it for probably a good 4-6 months maybe? Until I said I couldn’t stand being that sick on almost a daily basis. I lost about 15 lbs on the drug because I had no appetite and anything I ate I would just end up throwing up.

So I went a while (probably too long) without taking or controlling any of my sugar and of course after scheduling a much needed Drs appointment my a1c was 10.5  My doctor then prescribed me another injectable (made by the same manufacturer as the other) called Mounjaro. She claimed the side effects weren’t as bad as trulicity so I agreed to it. I was also given some insulin to help bring my sugars down.   Last Thursday I took my first shot of Mounjaro and the first day I felt fine. Awesome, right? Friday comes around and even though I wasn’t throwing up, I was still super nauseous (even took zofran) and I had the worst stomach ache ever and was constantly burping up what I called “sulfur burps” because it tastes like rotten eggs.

My muscles felt weak and shaky like I had no energy, I was light headed and dizzy, I had no appetite and overall just felt awful. I couldn’t be up for more than 10 minutes as a time before having to lay back down.

I wanted to share my story here for anyone who might relate and also hear some of y'all's stories if you've been through something similar.  **Background on me:** 32yo woman, diagnosed with PCOS around age 25 based on blood test results. My main symptoms are weight gain (I've struggled with my weight since puberty) and hirsutism. My period has always been pretty regular, albeit heavy.  **My birth control ~journey~:** I first started on birth control at age 28 with the Skyla IUD. It was wonderful for 3 years (much lighter period, helped somewhat with the excess hair on my face). It had a 3-year expiration, so I had to have it changed out last year. For some reason, my doctor didn't do Skyla again; she did a longer-term one that was larger. Insertion was incredibly painful because they didn't prescribe me cervix-softening meds. At my two-week follow up, she found that it was starting to travel up, so she removed it. She started me on the Slynd (progestin only) pill - not great experience, lots of intermittent bleeding. We decided to find something else, so she recommended trying out the Skyla IUD again. Another painful insertion. The day after insertion, I noticed that I couldn't feel the strings. After two different ultrasounds, my doctor concluded that it was just the strings that had moved and that the IUD was still in place, and she didn't think it would travel anymore. A week and a half later, I went for my follow up, and the IUD had traveled up so far that it was now stuck between my bladder and my uterus. So, a few days into 2022, I had to go into a laparoscopic surgery to have it removed. A different doctor at the practice did my surgery, and it went fine. She did my follow up a week or so later, and she prescribed a different hormonal birth control pill (not progestin only). About a month or so later, I went for a follow up with my own doctor, and I had higher blood pressure than normal. My doctor was shocked that her colleague had put me on that medication because it is known to raise blood pressure, and I already have elevated blood pressure at times. She switched me off of that and put me on Norethindrone, another progestin-only pill. This was in February, and I've been on that ever since. Since I've been on it, but particularly in the last six months, I haven't felt like myself. I've noticed an increase in depressive symptoms, and from May to September, I gained 20 pounds out of nowhere. And I'm happy to report that today, after my first appointment yesterday with an endocrinologist, I AM OFF HORMONAL BIRTH CONTROL! 🎉  **My appointment with the endocrinologist:** I was lucky enough to find an endocrinologist in my city that had amazing reviews, nothing less than five stars, which is rare to find in my area. It took about two months to get an appointment after a referral from my PCP. Going into the appointment, I had a few questions in mind:  * I want to get off this hormonal birth control ASAP - my PCP had told me that because my hormone levels were normal in my bloodwork, it was likely the birth control keeping those levels in check and that I shouldn't stop taking my birth control until I had the appointment with the endocrinologist. * My husband and I want to start trying for a baby in about a year/year and a half. How can I best prepare my body for that? * I don't feel like myself, and I feel like the weight gain is a huge part of that. I'm very disciplined when it comes to my food, and I am moderately active. Yet, I gained 20 pounds out of nowhere, and despite being extra disciplined and active for the past two months, nothing has changed.  Within the first minute of meeting this endocrinologist, I immediately felt good about it. It felt like she actually cared about my health as a whole and wanted to help me get on the right track, and I didn't feel rushed at all. She was also the only medical professional I've seen since the beginning of this year who was truly horrified at my IUD surgery experience - I felt so validated.  These were her conclusions from my appointment:  * I need to immediately stop the birth control. It's not working for my body (she attributed my rapid weight gain to it), plus given the timeline we have for wanting to try for kids, I need to see if I'm ovulating, so we can address that as needed. We talked through my other options for preventing pregnancy, and I'm just so relieved to finally have a doctor not pushing hormonal birth control on me. * I was given an additional diagnosis of a metabolic disorder/metabolic dysfunction, which she came to based on my difficulty to lose weight and the hair on my arms (I had never heard this before - I've always focused more on the hair on my face, but I guess I have lots of arm hair too!). * I was also reminded of my oh-so-lovely diagnosis of obesity 🙃 * To get me back to a healthy weight, and since I have not been able to do that alone despite all my best efforts, she recommended medication to help. We talked through the two different classes of drugs that can help, and I ultimately decided on the GLP-1 class, and she chose Ozempic.  **Post-appointment:**  * I did a bunch of research on Ozempic (including here on this subreddit), and I definitely think it's a great idea to try it out. I was encouraged by the success stories I've read, and I'm very cognizant of how I can be on this medication, still eat healthy/be active, but also try my best to maintain a health relationship with food. * I got a call today from their office, and surprise surprise, my insurance did not approve me for Ozempic. My endocrinologist decided to start me on Mounjaro instead, and I can pick up the prescription tomorrow.  I am honestly just so hopeful for this next step. I have had a really great year (got married, got a promotion), but my body has been my biggest struggle by far in 2022. I have tried so hard to have a good body image and to not worry about what I look like, but I've just felt like crap. I've been so disciplined, yet I still feel so low energy, so tired, and I've hated how I feel.  I think this approach of 1) getting off hormonal birth control and 2) starting on Mounjaro could be the first step toward feeling better in my body and hopefully being able to conceive when I want to.

She was also the only medical professional I've seen since the beginning of this year who was truly horrified at my IUD surgery experience - I felt so validated.  These were her conclusions from my appointment:  * I need to immediately stop the birth control. It's not working for my body (she attributed my rapid weight gain to it), plus given the timeline we have for wanting to try for kids, I need to see if I'm ovulating, so we can address that as needed. We talked through my other options for preventing pregnancy, and I'm just so relieved to finally have a doctor not pushing hormonal birth control on me. * I was given an additional diagnosis of a metabolic disorder/metabolic dysfunction, which she came to based on my difficulty to lose weight and the hair on my arms (I had never heard this before - I've always focused more on the hair on my face, but I guess I have lots of arm hair too!). * I was also reminded of my oh-so-lovely diagnosis of obesity 🙃 * To get me back to a healthy weight, and since I have not been able to do that alone despite all my best efforts, she recommended medication to help. We talked through the two different classes of drugs that can help, and I ultimately decided on the GLP-1 class, and she chose Ozempic.  **Post-appointment:**  * I did a bunch of research on Ozempic (including here on this subreddit), and I definitely think it's a great idea to try it out. I was encouraged by the success stories I've read, and I'm very cognizant of how I can be on this medication, still eat healthy/be active, but also try my best to maintain a health relationship with food. * I got a call today from their office, and surprise surprise, my insurance did not approve me for Ozempic. My endocrinologist decided to start me on Mounjaro instead, and I can pick up the prescription tomorrow.  I am honestly just so hopeful for this next step. I have had a really great year (got married, got a promotion), but my body has been my biggest struggle by far in 2022. I have tried so hard to have a good body image and to not worry about what I look like, but I've just felt like crap. I've been so disciplined, yet I still feel so low energy, so tired, and I've hated how I feel.  I think this approach of 1) getting off hormonal birth control and 2) starting on Mounjaro could be the first step toward feeling better in my body and hopefully being able to conceive when I want to.  My apologies for the absolute novel that this has turned into, and props to anyone who made it this far.

Current photo.  ////INTRO  So for starters.\xa0 I\'m a 30 year old male and 5\'-10"" from California.\xa0 I was always into sports in my youth, and was definitely an ectomorph.\xa0 In high school I wrestled freshman year at 120lbs, and ended as a senior at about 140 lbs.\xa0 I was 7% body fat throughout most of this time (measured).\xa0 I could never put on weight, let alone muscle.\xa0 I had a very poor diet as well, as my parents weren\'t health nuts.\xa0 I could eat whatever I wanted and never put on any weight other than natural weight from growing.\xa0   After high school, I started lifting for the first time.\xa0 I was never particularly strong, maxing at 185lbs bench after about 1.5 years of training.\xa0 I weighed in around 165, and had a guesstimate of about 12%-15% body fat, so my body did start gaining some weight finally.\xa0   At 20 years old I met my now wife.\xa0 I gave up on the gym after about a year (our relationship was tumultuous as she was 18 and I was 20, we both smoked Marijuana, she was going to college, etc.\xa0 Not a recipe for a long term relationship)\xa0 My weight stayed about the same but I lost a good amount of muscle mass.\xa0   At about 28 I started going to the gym again but very periodically, and my diet was never too good.   When covid hit, my physique took its worst turn.\xa0 The gym shut down and I had no at home gym equipment.\xa0 I was depressed, ate the worst diet of my life, never exercised at all (outside of work).\xa0 For the first time ever, I started really putting on fat.\xa0 LIKE REALLY putting on fat (for me).\xa0   At this time I also started experiencing some new health issues / symptoms.\xa0 I associated them with my lack of exercise, poor diet, etc.\xa0 These were my symptoms:   -Weight gain (obviously).  -Very slight hair thinning, but noticeable. Hairline strong but less hair density and thinner strands.\xa0   -Lowered libido (not lost but much lower than ever.\xa0 My wife is very beautiful and I\'m very attracted to her still 10 years later which may be hard to believe, but it\'s true).  -Some Erectile quality issues, but not dramatic.\xa0 Again I attributed this to just being out of shape.  -FATIGUE.\xa0 Heavy fatigue.\xa0 The best way I ever could describe it was after work (6am-230pm with a 45 minute commute before and after) I felt like it was about 2AM.\xa0 Like I had just stayed up all night.  -Sleeping issues / sweating at night (even with air conditioned room as cold as I please).  -Vision issues (I now wear glasses for the first time in my life.\xa0 Could be unrelated, I didn\'t see an Optometrist until I was 30).  It was at this time, especially when I looked in the mirror, I thought I better go to the doctor for a checkup (hadn\'t been in years).   2/20/2021- I got bloodwork done, including the following (all from my PCP):  [PCP Bloodwork 1](  My results all came back normal with these exceptions:   LDL Cholesterol 109 (ref range <100)(my PCP advised me that this was acceptable, my Total Cholesterol was 193 [ref range <200] and HDL 68 [ref range >/= 40] with my CHOL/HDLC Ratio being 2.8 (<3.5 is highly desirable)   Ketones: 1+ (my doctor didn\'t bring this up with me.\xa0 So I don\'t have good answers about this, and will explain more shortly.\xa0 I was eating carbs, and was not working out.\xa0 This was at my worst).  Protein: Trace (will expand on this later but doctor said this is acceptable).  Vitamin D: 21 (ref range 30-100) normal issue, easily remedied with supplementation.  TESTOSTERONE: 250 (ref range 250-827) WHOA HOLD UP.\xa0 This really caught me off guard.\xa0 This was the last thing I was expecting...   We discussed the testosterone at length and my PCP said she strongly recommends seeing a urologist.\xa0\xa0 I schedule the visit shortly thereafter.\xa0   The Urologist sees my bloodwork and is concerned.\xa0 However, my bloodwork was done in the afternoon (fasting, but in the afternoon nonetheless)   He recommends to retest my testosterone fasting and in the morning.\xa0   3/4/2021: [AM Fasting Total Testosterone #1](  I return with the results of the new testosterone bloodwork.\xa0 It was 463.\xa0 So not as low, but still not optimal.\xa0   My urologist recommendation:\xa0 diet and exercise!\xa0   Me: ok that sounds reasonable!\xa0   So for the next 3 months, I seriously changed my lifestyle.\xa0 I started eating a very strict and healthy diet, counting calories, focusing on protein intake, healthy carbs, healthy fats, but still indulge in a cheat meal about once a week to two weeks.\xa0 No more soda or sugary drinks, little to no alcohol (1 to 2 drinks per week max).\xa0   I bought at home weights including high quality barbell and ethos weights, dumbells, a half rack and bench, exercise bike.\xa0   I lift 5 times a week on average.\xa0 I was making progress, but my symptoms were only getting worse.\xa0 Currently this is what my 3 month progress looks like, going from 182 to 169 pounds.   [3 month natty transformation photos](   I haven\'t felt worse in my life.\xa0 The only way I make it through a workout is with a stim laced pre workout (was using noxplode for the butthole itches but just recently switched to gorilla mind)   So currently I just had more bloodwork done this time from my PCP.\xa0   9/4/2021- The results:   [PCP Bloodwork #2 w/ Free Test](  I\'m not sure exactly what to make of this bloodwork, mainly because I\'m not hyper educated, even though I know some of the basics, I\'m not sure of the fine details, such as the TSH being 0.90 which is on the very low end of normal (am I in pre-hyperthyroidism range?) And also not sure what to make of the Test / Free Test / SHBG ratio.\xa0   Pausing for a second, I just want to point out how learning I had low testosterone made me feel.\xa0 It was embarrassing, and made me feel like less of a man to be honest.\xa0 I thought about how guys take steroids, but never knew about TRT and therapeutic levels to optimize wellness.\xa0 Watching Derek taught me a lot about health and balance and how being open about these things is important, and opened my mind more to the idea of TRT rather than the taboo of gym roids, but I digress.   I spoke to an intake specialist from Marek (I won\'t be naming names here for privacy of the individuals) and he was alarmed by the ketones and trace protein, as well as such low levels of testosterone for being a 30 year old yet otherwise healthy male (unless I have something undiagnosed).\xa0 He speculated my average was probably about 300 across the course of the day.\xa0 I opted for the comprehensive panel they offer, and got my blood taken on 9/10/2021.   I will update this post from here.\xa0 Thanks for reading and any advice.\xa0  ////UPDATE 1:  Got blood work in from Labcorp.  I will include the reference ranges Labcorp lists, as I do not know if Marek wants their reference ranges listed here.  See below.  Here\'s a summary aka the ""MPMD BRO Numbers"" the full lab work will be underneath.  AST: 18 IU/L  ALT: 15 IU/L  Cholesterol Total: 178 mg/dL  Triglycerides: 79 mg/dL  HDL: 48 mg/dL  LDL: 115 mg/dL  LDL/HDL Ratio: 2.4 mg/dL  Test Total: 338.6 ng/dL :(((  Free Test: 9.38 :((((  % Free Test: 2.77%  DHEA-S: 367.0 ug/dL  LH: 3.7 mIU/mL  FSH: 3.0 mIU/mL  IGF-1: 179 ng/mL  Estradiol: 11.3 pg/mL :(((  SHBG: 22.4 nmol/L  Like I said, the full blood work is below.  I have a few concerns obviously, from Test, to Cgolesterol, to Ketones in urine, and Estradiol / SHBG. The FSH and LH could be better also as well as a few other things I\'m sure.  I am in the process of scheduling an appointment with Marek now to go over bloodwork and see what treatment they recommend.       Date: 9/10/2021  Fasting: Yes  Time: AM   [LabCorp Results](  ////UPDATE 2:  Today (9/27/2021) I had my consultation with Marek regarding bloodwork and treatment.  I dont have the exact treatment plan yet, so there are a few other things I may be taking, but regarding testosterone and TRT:  I was asked if I had a preference of treatment, and what my goals are.  I was also asked about fertility, and if that is important to me personally.    I explained I don\'t have a preference on treatment, as I have stated in this thread building to this point.  I\'ve already maintained that I would only take TRT if it was what they thought it was best to me.    I further explained my main goals are treating my symptoms of fatigue, libido, energy levels, etc.  I explained my longevity and overall well being are main number one priority.    Lastly, in terms of fertility.  I do not have children, and my wife is on birth control.  But I\'m 30, and my wife does talk about wanting kids.  She\'s only 27.  So I do want the option of having kids on the table.    That being said, my Marek consultation resulted in a conclusion I feel very good about.  I agreed with the recommendation of Enclomiphene over TRT.    Enclomiphene is a Non-Steroidal Estrogen Receptor Antagonist (not to be confused with Clomid or Clomiphene).  It is a trans-stereoisomer of clomiphene citrate.  What exactly that means is above my pay grade.    From what I understand, the way Enclomiphene works is by \xa0antagonzing the\xa0estrogen receptor of the\xa0Pituitary.  Thus reducing\xa0negative feedback\xa0by estrogen on the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal axis. Causing increased Gonadotropin secretion by the Pituitary leading to more natural testosterone production in the testicles. Pretty much it increases your LH and FSH, which tells your balls to produce more testosterone.  Since there is more testosterone, there is more estrogen naturally through aromitization.    I will learn more about Enclomiphene I\'m sure, and of course I do not know how my personal response will be.  Will update again with full treatment plan.  ////UPDATE 3: Full treatment plan recommendations  [Treatment Plan](  So as you can see the enclomiphene at 12.5mg per day orally, D3 and vitamin K combo 1 capsule per day orally, lipo capsule (inositol, choline, B12, chromium) 1 per day orally, and DHEA SR 10mg per day orally.  I opted for all 4 recommendations as they all seem logical.  The only thing I\'m unsure about is the DHEA SR so I will be doing some research and reading studies on the effects and benefits versus risk to E2 climbing.    I will update once I am about 2 weeks into my treatment with initial thoughts and how I feel.  ////UPDATE 4: First DXA Scan   [DXA Scan 10/1/2021 Natty](  So take what you will from this, it\'s pretty much what I expected.  I mainly wanted the scan for my Calorie calculations to be as accurate as possible.  An RMR is more ideal, but this is still better than an online calculator.  ////UPDATE 5: First day on Enclomiphene and DHEA SR  So I don\'t want to really talk about how I feel today specifically.  There are a number of factors that can show as results of the treatment but have nothing to do with it, including the placebo effect, my training, sleep, etc.  So I\'m going to just state that typically results in serum levels are 2 weeks. So I will give my consensus then.  What I can say for sure is there was a pep in my step, simply from the dopamine hit of knowing I started my treatment and the excitement of that thought alone.  See below for my last set of Natty photos, for everything after this will technically be enhanced on enclomiphene.  Will update after 2 weeks with my early thoughts and any side effects or other things I may notice.  [5 Month Natty Results, Final Natty Photos](  ////UPDATE 6: 2 Weeks on Enclomiphene  I just want to preface this by saying everyone experiences different results with compounds.  Also, the details listed next are a result of my whole treatment plan, and I do not want anything to be attributed to one specific compound.  These are my personal results with my specific treatment plan and your results may be drastically different than mine.  So after 2 weeks on Enclomiphene 12.5mg ED, DHEA SR ED, and my Vitamin regiment, I would have to say I do not see much on the way of changes.  I haven\'t missed a single dose, and everything was taken as instructed.  I\'ve been on antibiotics as well for an unrelated infection (Cipro 250mg twice daily) and I have also been at a caloric deficit for several months (dropping from 182 to 165 between April 2021 and Today October 21 2021).  The reason I mention these things is they can have negative effects on energy levels as well.  On the topic of energy levels, I don\'t feel any substantial changes.  Some days I think I feel better then the next day or by 2pm I\'m exhausted.  Had two of the worst fatigue days I\'ve experienced this week actually.  I also tried cutting out caffeine in the morning to see if that was causing my midday crash.  It didn\'t generate any changes.  My libido seems to be about the same as normal, (not very good but I still do have a libido)  and my workouts seem to be the same as well.  No noticeable changes in body composition outside my normal progression.  Muscle recovery is still in the toilet.   In terms of side effects, I don\'t think I have any significant ones.  The only thing I\'ve noticed was my sensitivity to temperature may have gotten a tad worse, and I have been having ""hot flashes"" assuming I\'m correct about what I\'m experiencing.  I tend to sweat at night as well, even with the AC on.  Even with the sweating, I haven\'t seen any change in my Acne (I\'ve always had a very small amount of acne on my back, nothing crazy) and lately I started using an OTC treatment that has actually helped it improve.  Mood seems stable, I don\'t feel excessively angry or sad.  My wife says she hasn\'t noticed any Abnormal moodiness.  No signs of Gyno or breast tissue changes.   Keep in mind I\'m only 2 weeks in, and from the studies I read the most significant changes were over 6 weeks.  I\'ll continue to update if anything changes, or every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks. Stay tuned..  ////UPDATE 7: 6 week enclomiphene bloodwork and 8 week body photos  6 weeks enclomiphene bloods   So I was fairly surprised to see my Testosterone Total climb from 338 to 944.  Pretty impressive numbers, keep in mind though this is combined with a very consistent healthy diet, sleeping hygiene, and working out consistently.  Not to mention the DHEA-SR as well as other vitamins all are contributing factors.   In terms of symptom relief, I definitely feel more energetic.  However, it doesn\'t last through the day.  Most of my energy is up until about 2 to 3pm.  Which is not optimal, as I work out right at that time usually.  I also have not seen any changes in libido, which is also disappointing.   I also noticed my Estradiol more than quadrupled.  I\'m not sure how to interpret this, and if this is a sign I am prone to high levels of aromatization or not.    I also noticed my TSH nearly doubled. My cholesterol has gone down but only a bit.  My AST and ALT are up but still not high enough to be concerned with.  My kidney results are a bit worrying and I will be consulting with Marek today to get info on that.    My main goals right now are focused around symptom relief, not numbers.  (For hormones)  My other main goals are my heart kidney and liver health, which I do not have symptoms with these but the numbers need looking at.   TRT is not off the table for me. My appointment with Marek today will determine the course though.    Here is my body from original baseline (around April before working out) to Natty with working out, to enhanced with enclomiphene.  Take what you will from the 8 week progression, keep in mind I\'m still in nooby gains territory, so the progression could have happened without the enclomiphene, it\'s hard to say.     Baseline to 3 months Natty   5 month natty   8 weeks enclomiphene / 7 months working out   ////UPDATE 8- more bloods on enclomiphene and new treatment plan from Marek  Here is another set of bloodwork I did with my PCP (outside of marek) they just wanted to do bloodwork for whatever reason, not receiving any medication from my PCP.      Pretty impressive numbers honestly, over 1000 ng/dL Total Test with high free test and bioavailable test (which I didn\'t even know was a different marker from free test)   Also my cholesterol looks much better here than the labcorp report prior, and the Thyroid levels look decent to me although I don\'t know much about Thyroid markers.  Other than that everything looks good, I was happy to see me eGFR looking better as well although I know eGFR isn\'t very accurate.    After consulting with Marek, I will be discontinuing Enclomiphene and DHEA and starting a new treatment plan (I will still be taking the lipo capsule and vitamins)  My reasoning is that while my bloodwork looks great, I don\'t have enough symptom relief to warrant continuing Enclomiphene.  No change in libido at all (if anything maybe even slightly worse) changes in energy were limited to the 8am-1pm time frame which was nice but not enough to optimize my enjoyment of life.  Also no changes in the gym and with my overall body composition in my opinion, the progression of my composition was linear to pre enclomiphene and my lifts aren\'t going up at all.    My new treatment plan (in addition to the vitamin D3+K2, Magnesium, Zinc picolinate, lipo capsule, multivitamin) is as follows:  Testosterone Cypionate 120mg/week in 40mg Monday / Wednesday / Friday dosing schedule   Ezetimibe 10mg Monday Wednesday Friday dosing schedule   Tadalafil 5mg troche Daily   So I\'m very excited to start TRT.  I\'ve been patient, seen what other options are out there and explored them, and decided I\'m ready to commit to TRT.  I\'ve proven to myself that I know what I\'m doing, I know my body, and I have educated myself and invested many hours of research.  Enclomiphene can be a viable option depending on personal response  but for me I feel like it gave me a taste of how I should feel (the mornings have changed and I felt like wow so this is what having energy actually feels like, as I apparently didn\'t even remember what it feels like) but the problem was the energy was fleeting.  I want to feel like that at least until 8 or 9pm, to get through workouts at 3/4pm and still have energy to cook, do dishes, shower, make my lunch etc without just wanting to give up.  I\'m also excited about the potential to finally put on muscle, as I\'ve been devoted to a strict but maintainable diet and a training plan that I can now modify with hopefully enhanced recovery.  As of writing this, if I do leg day on Monday, I\'m still feeling it by Friday.  And that\'s without progressive overload, my lifts haven\'t gone up in months of consistent training.    The ezetimibe is for Cholesterol which I would like to see significant changes in, seeing as my cholesterol is already not optimal getting on TRT could potentially worsen that, so it gives me peace of mind knowing I\'m counteracting a potential negative process.  Lastly tadalafil aka cialis, which most people think of it as a ED drug, it has many other uses, including lowering blood pressure, increased pumps at the gym, and better blood flow overall.  I\'m hoping this helps me, because I do have some issues with poor blood flow and numbness.    I will update again 2 weeks after starting TRT  as I am still waiting on the treatment plan to be compounded and shipped.  ////UPDATE 9- 2 weeks on TRT  Unfortunately, I caught covid on Christmas Day.  So no real 2 week update as planned, obviously due to covid I\'m not feeling the best.  Once I get over covid, I will see how I\'m feeling.  Most likely the 2 month or 4 month update will have solid results hopefully.  Should be getting more bloods done around the 10 week mark to see what my levels look like.  ////UPDATE 10- 10 Weeks on TRT with bloodwork    So I ended up getting bloodwork at 10 weeks on my TRT dosage.  Thyroid looks good, hematology looks good, lipids are much better now, kidney and liver function on point, c reactive protein and PSA showing heart and Prostate markings that are low.  Free Test on the high side but according to Marek is fine.  889 total test is pretty damn optimal.  Estrogen and Prolactin elevated as expected but I have no estrogenic side effects (will explain more after this section). The one question I had was about the DHEA being tanked, this was most likely caused by Prednisolone I was taking for a back injury I sustained recently.   Major side effects: so far only some moderate acne (nothing system, just small inflamed acneform folliculitis) and oily skin, with maybe some increase in blood pressure.  I had slightly high blood pressure to begin with though, and I have upped the Tadalafil dose to 10mg ED which keeps my BP in check.  No signs of hair loss but I am on finasteride and minoxidil.  As for the results: Amazing!  Libido is incredible, energy is great, erectile quality is perfect.  Pretty much optimized.  I am increasing to 200mg a week for 8 weeks to aid the recovery of my back by helping those lumbar muscles grow faster with physical therapy but will then return to 120mg a week as this level is optimal.  As far as muscular gains and gym energy, those I haven\'t seen dramatic improvements.  I might be a little bigger and a little leaner but again, nothing dramatic.  I also was out of the gym for 6 weeks, so this played an unfortunate part.  However I\'m back in the gym and focusing more than ever.   ////UPDATE 11  After a recent back injury, I am now in Physical Therapy and upped my TRT dose to 200mg a week to help rebuild the atrophied muscles to enhance my recovery time.  This will be 8 weeks long then revert back to the 120mg  I also added Injectable L-Carnitine to my regimen, dosed at 250mg pre workout utilizing .5cc from a 500mg/mL solution.  Will report back on my experience with this.  After unsuccessfully working with my Dermatologist on attenuation my Acne situation (it\'s not horrible but it\'s noticeable enough and it\'s on my forearms even) I\'m going to do a round of Accutane because I\'m just over having acne, and also very oily skin (I wear glasses / contacts and when I wear my glasses the oils always get all over them, making cleaning them several times a day a PITA)  ////UPDATE 12  Starting my cut today, adding Rauwolscine and upping Turkesterone to 2000mg daily, with the intent of upping to 3000mg May 1st.  TRT Dose still on 200mg Per week, and taking Raloxifene.  Waiting on my order of semaglutide as well, may not need it.  Current weight 182.5 lbs, peak was 186.

13,13,429,13_saxenda_wegovy_switch_dose,"14: saxenda, wegovy, switch","['saxenda', 'wegovy', 'switch', 'dose', 'shortage']","['Update: Reporting back to this sub on my experience moving from Saxenda to Wegovy (as requested)!. Hi everyone. I\'ve been a frequent poster in here over the past several months. In my last post, I shared my results on Saxenda (total time, about 7 months) and was planning on moving to Wegovy. Here\'s a breakdown of my stats:  * 26F, 5\'9"", moderately active (10k+ steps/day, workout 3-5x/week) * Highest weight: 270+ lbs * Starting weight (Saxenda): 256 lbs * Ending weight (Saxenda): 204 lbs * Current weight (2.5 weeks on Wegovy): 198 lbs * Goal weight: 160ish lbs (?)  To be clear, I didn\'t switch to Wegovy because I was having issues with Saxenda - I tolerated it very well with minimal side effects. It costs the same on my insurance, is more effective in clinical trials, requires only 1 injection/week, and side effects weren\'t too much of a concern for me given how well I tolerated Saxenda. My doctor (I see a PCP and also an obesity medicine specialist, will no longer be seeing the latter thanks to my progress, but he was the one who prescribed the switch to Wegovy) generally moves patients from 3mg Saxenda to 1mg Wegovy (so, the middle dose/month 3).   Anyways, I took my first injection the night before a vacation (ski trip) and crossed my fingers. Thankfully, everything went pretty well! I find the appetite suppression to be greater than when I was on Saxenda, and like Saxenda, experienced mild nausea the day after my first shot, but it lasted longer than when I was on Saxenda. Each week the nausea has decreased, and I no longer experienced it after 2 shots. Constipation is about the same, and I haven\'t experienced any other side effects.   On Saxenda before the switch, I was averaging approximately 2000-2100 cal/day. Since being on Wegovy, I find I\'m averaging around 1600-1700 cal/day, so I\'m consuming approximately 20% fewer calories on this medication vs. Saxenda. The resulting deficit tracks with my weight loss, which is back on a pace of ~2-2.5 lbs/week. As of this week I\'m officially no longer obese by BMI and under 200 lbs for the first time since I was a kid.   Everything else equal (cost, side effects, etc), I\'m very happy with the switch. If side effects are an issue for you, I would approach switching more cautiously/chat with your doctor - the side effects do certainly hit harder/last longer in duration. Some people had requested I report back here about my experience, so I hope they see this post and that it might help anyone else considering switching!', 'Aussies using Juniper. This was posted to the Facebook group today by Juniper - interesting to note I haven’t received any emails or official comma from Juniper, just this post.   🔔 Important update for Saxenda patients 🔔  To our community,  Due to continued supply challenges, our stock of Saxenda is running extremely low.

Got this message from my pharmacy today:  Medication Shortages  As a result of the extremely high demand for weight loss medications in Australia, and globally, we are forecasting a temporary shortage of your medication.  We would like to assure all patients that we are working closely with the national supplier to secure next orders, but in the meantime this dosage adjustment will help your supply last longer with little to no impact on your weight loss progress.     Frequently Asked Questions   How do I change my dose?  If you are on 0.6mg  We recommend increasing your dose to 1.2mg as per the schedule and remain on this dose.  If you are on 1.8mg, 2.4mg or 3mg  We recommend reducing your next dose to 1.2mg and remaining on this dose. It is safe to reduce your dose when you are due for your next injection.     Why is there another shortage?  We know this is a frustrating position for our patients to be in. GLP-1 medications are playing a vital role in helping tackle obesity. The world is catching on, but the manufacturers have not been able to adjust their production forecasts to meet immediate demand. We are working very closely with the global drug manufacturers and local wholesalers to secure enough supply for our existing patients to continue their weight loss journey, and we are responding as quickly as possible based on evolving information.     When will the shortage end?  Unfortunately we don’t know how long this issue will last, but we are committed to keeping you informed with regular updates when we have them. In the meantime, we are working hard to replenish our stocks and, to ensure our long-standing members are best supported, we are accepting fewer new members in order to put you and your health first.     Is only Pilot affected?  Supply changes are not limited to Pilot. Pharmacies across the country and other online clinics are affected by changes to supply and distribution of treatments. However, Pilot is in direct contact with the global supplier of our most commonly prescribed weight loss treatment, which means we are among the first to receive new stock.     How can I stay updated on the shortage?  Refilling stocks and alleviating delays to our current patients is our main focus, and any updates we receive will be shared with you immediately. Our health coaches will be posting regularly in the Facebook community, we’ll keep the app home screen updated, and we’ll send emails with any developments. We will also update this article regularly with new and emerging questions.     Will this impact my order if it is currently processing?   If your order is currently processing and being dispensed by the pharmacy, it will be shipped out as normal.     Will this shortage affect my results?  While weight loss is most effective using the 3mg dose long-term, there’s evidence that over short periods of time, such as 3 months or less, weight loss outcomes are similar between the 1.2mg and 3mg dose. This means that despite a temporary reduction in your daily dose, your long-term weight loss outcomes should remain largely unaffected.     What happens if I run out?  We understand the thought of running out of medication may be daunting, but our experienced clinical team assures there is no clinical risk if you run out of supply or have to stop suddenly. Limiting your daily dosage to 1.2mg will help prolong your supply, but if you do find you need to stop for a period of days or weeks, know that we’ll work with you closely to support your journey and ensure any flow-on effects are limited.  Our health coaching and medical support team of dietitians, registered nurses, pharmacists and nutritionists are at your fingertips and can support you through any changes to appetite or eating habits.     Will there be any changes to the cost of treatment?  To keep in line with your lowered treatment dosage, the monthly fee will now be charged every second month. You don’t need to change anything in your account, we’ll take care of it on our end.     How do I get in touch with my doctor?  We can put you in touch with your doctor whenever you need. Please send us a message here to request a doctor consult.     Can I get my treatment now?  Unfortunately, we are unable to refill your treatment immediately due to medication shortages. Your next order date will be updated automatically based on your order schedule and the new dosing recommendations. If you are running out of treatment, please send us a message here.']"

Hey guys Constantine here from reddit dot com  I just found out via email from the site i buy BPC from about this newly FDA approved peptide called tirzepatide. From the studies I\'ve read, it seems like a pretty low risk high reward peptide for fat loss. Currently its being marketed as a diabetes medication first and a weight loss treatment second but I\'ll copy and paste some relevant part from studies i\'ve found  ""in one trial, three doses of tirzepatide (given subcutaneously once weekly) were compared with placebo in 478 patients, most of whom were not taking other diabetes medications. During 40 weeks of treatment, all 3 doses lowered mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by about 2 percentage points (from a baseline of 7.9%) and reduced mean weight by 7 to 9 kg (from a baseline of 86 kg). Neither HbA1c level nor weight changed in the placebo group. Severe hypoglycemia did not occur.  Tirzepatide showed robust improvements in glycemic control and bodyweight, without increased risk of hypoglycemia. The safety profile was consistent with GLP-1 receptor agonists, indicating a potential monotherapy use of tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes treatment.""  for all non metric people 86 kg is 189 lbs, which is not obese (obviously depending on height etc) and I would reckon that majority of people who lift are above this weight and at that weight range the effects were the same as those were are actually obese obese, results being a loss of up to 20% of body weight. Seems like it would be a good add on to a cutting cycle, possibly test + something to prevent catabolic breakdowns + tizepatide.  I\'d be interested in someone who is more well versed than me (hopefully Derek) look into this and break it down further.  link with some studies below:  ', 'I\'m sorry for the post here, but please use the search function before asking a question.

(My first time doing this, I hope it\'s not too long or trivial, and also a big shoutout to we-feed-the-fire for all the high quality recaps I\'ve seen)  *Singing*  ""Where are you BeeBeeJunes?!"" several times  She missed everyone. She\'s trying to recover.  ""Feeling uh...ugh...I dunno. I\'m feeling a little worn out.""  She dyed her hair a bit dark, a blue black. It looks straightened.  Shows the lint roller full of fur. Blames Chubbyuse. Says she needs to trim him.  She had Thai food with Peetz and it hit the spot.  Decided she needed ice cream so she ordered a Blizzard from Dairy Queen, the small size, didn\'t finish it though. (Yeah, sure.)  Shows empty lemonade and blue raspberry slushie, ""full of sugar, I know, but it was really good!""  Says when she\'s been up late and partying too much she needs sugar.  Shows 3X sweatpants that are both too tight and too long. ""I think they fit pretty well.""  ""Uuughhh, I wanna slush puppy. Full of sugar. FULL OF SUGAR!""  Won\'t be on that long because she has to go take Peetz grocery shopping.  Someone in chat asks if she\'ll get coffee and go for a walk. She needs another day to recoup.  (She\'s been out of breath the whole stream, has been panting every 10-30 seconds)  She also got broccoli and shrimp with the Thai food and it was so good.  She watched Willy Wonderland with Peetz last night and it was so funny.  Complains about how her tonsils are feeling. Says she just needs to eat good and just rest.  ""I was really stupid. Really stupid. Treating my body really badly. Giving it substances that...not good. Yeah my tonsils are swollen.""  Says she went probably three days without eating or barely eating. Has been taking her antidepressants and the withdrawal is bad. Makes her nauseous and she hates that feeling.  ""I did some things I\'m not proud of. Tried some substances I\'m not proud of. Stuff I never thought I would do and it made me really sick. Sick sick sick.""  It\'s not because of Dom, he said he\'d be mad if she did it, it\'s because she just wanted to try it. She wouldn\'t do it again.  He really isn\'t a druggie. He\'s not addicted. (Suuuuuure.)  ""Not every single night I was over we did hard stuff, it was just the one night, and then the other nights we didn\'t.""  The mixture of stuff made her sick in bed for two days. It\'s not why she ""decided"" to end things with him. (Was it you who decided though??)  Annoyed, ""I know, I was bad, I was really bad...""  She told Peetz the mixture of what she took, he told her she\'s better than that, she\'s not white trash.  ""I\'m like, I am white traaaash...""  She didn\'t realize she could have died or ODed.  Asian Lover sends a superchat asking if she wants to get married and have kids. She answers she wants to get married maybe someday but can\'t have kids.  ""It was, I guess I just wanted to try one time."" It was disgusting. She\'s not interested in drugs besides these (holds up Faded Fruit Pack edibles).  She did a mixture of three things that at first felt good and she couldn\'t stop moving, then she felt horribly sick and was dry heaving for two days. When she thought the horrible feeling would go away, it would come back.  Thought she was dying because her pee smelled really bad and was orange, almost red. She\'s feeling a lot better now.  ""I swear I\'ll never do those things again, never never never...""  It was molly. Way too much of it.  She didn\'t realize what it was. She should\'ve looked into it more. All she could do was stand at the window.  Didn\'t realize that being on Ozempic too might interact with the other drugs.  Says to stay the hell away from drugs, it\'s not good.  She didn\'t like the feeling at all. Edibles are better.  Feels like she lost a lot of weight in those two days because she wasn\'t eating, was doing sex, drugs, and beezin\'.  When Dom saw how sick she was he cried.  She doesn\'t know how long it\'ll take for her to get better, and go for walks in her new shoes.  Tony Montana\'s hot. She loves Al Pacino.  She thinks she had way too much of it. It was wrapped in a little tissue, Dom said it was enough for her, and would make her feel good when he touched her.  The first night was the beeze. The second or third night they did only edibles and that\'s when they were just laughing and talking abd having fun.  Says she\'ll tell chat but she\'s never doing it ever again. Blows nose hard.  Started off doing wine. She asked him if he could get molly. He got a gram or was it two grams? Wrapped a bit in a tissue and told her to swallow it.  She asked for more. He gave her the rest of it.  There was like a glass tube with a circle and it was meth. ""If I ever see you ask for it again I\'ll be so mad at you. You have to promise never to do it again.""  It tasted like burnt plastic. She didn\'t feel much since it was just one *hooft* of it.  *Phone ringing for several seconds.*  You have to drink so much water because you dehydrate so easily. It was DISGUSTING.  She doesn\'t know how people do that like, ongoing.  Probably did it because she was feeling good from the molly.  She was sweating so much and dry heaving for two days. She\'s trying to recover from all of this crap. Had all the symptoms of an overdose.  She had chest pain, was dizzy, was throwing up.  She realizes now hard stuff isn\'t a joke. People\'s lives are like, ruined by this stuff.  She says she has to go soon to get cat food and take Peetz for groceries.  She doesn\'t know when she\'ll feel normal again. She just wants to feel normal. She needs vitamin C and a lot of other vitamins.  She\'s not proud of what happened. But...yeah, she\'s a beezer sometimes.  If she doesn\'t feel better she might go to the hospital. It\'s embarrassing admitting that though at the hospital.  Well, she told us what she did. Doesn\'t know why but maybe it\'s because she can\'t keep anything to herself.  Hungry! She wants Thai food and one of those lemonade slushie things.  Dom was actually telling her not to take stuff (I assume after the molly). She\'s just stupid, she says.  She doesn\'t want attention, she just wanted...you know. She did what she did. (Sounds like attention and she didn\'t have another answer)  Admits people telling her what she\'s doing isn\'t good for her is right but in a deflective, getting-it-over-with way.  ""I\'m gonna delete it, cause I don\'t wanna trigger people.""  Someone says they used to do MDMA and ecstasy a bunch but only the dirty stuff made them feel bad. ""Oh, didn\'t know that.""  She\'s not retracting what she said by deleting the stream.', ""Top 10 Worst Commercials of The Last 12 Months. I've Been Meaning To Do This For a Few Days So Here We Go.

Sometimes, The Car Companies Never Learn Their Lesson.  &#x200B;  **Number 8: Ozempic**  I've Been Hating Ozempic Ever Since I First Saw Their Commercials, But Now, I Am Seeing Them a Little Too Much. For Starters, It's That Stupid Jingle At The Start Of Their Commercials. A Jingle That Makes Everybody's Ears Bleed. In Every Commercial They Have Aired, It's Always The Same: Random Shoobs Doing Random Crap. I Really Don't Care About These Commercials And I Hope These Are No Longer On Our TV's.  &#x200B;  **Number 7: Shriners**  When I First Joined This Reddit Community Last Month, I Saw a Few Post About Shriners Hospitals For Children.

Hi guys  Saw a doc and he gave me sample of Rybelsus.  Prior doc prescribed me Mounjaro but was denied by insurance and that doc didn’t feel like appealing or writing me for another semi with a better diagnosis.  (Technically I qualify as metabolic syndrome also )  So anyway I got a box of 3 mg months supply   I wanna try to max out gains I can make or if I can stretch it out   Does this last all day ?  Technically I don’t need appetite suppression during the day.   I take long and short acting amphetamines for my my adhd and they are quite good at appetite suppression but as they wear off I start eating and “catching up”    I workout 6d per week and so far two months into it just ear breafast after gym then nothing till early evening /late afternoon.    Has anyone  tried taking Rybelsus later in the day ?  Wonder if long  I’d have to water and food fast during the day to equate the “first thing in the morning “ empty stomach.   Could I take half the pill and get coverage at least for maybe six hours until I go to sleep ?  Any advice is appreciated.    Oh the doc who got denied Metformin P.A. ended up prescribing me Metformin 500 2x daily.   I took it cuz figured why not especially as it may help wi to future approval for step therapy. 🤷\u200d♂️  Thanks for any advice.  Just seeing how i can  max out gains on this one sample box.   Ideal weight loss would be 15-20 lbs.   40s male , need this much to lose fat in the face.  Prob 30-40 total to be beach ready.   Started testosterone therapy and figured with workout it will help shredding but so far I’m gaining muscle but the belly fat is staying.     I think I can keep the weight off once achieved cuz I also workout regularly but I cannot kick start this current fat.  My ideal weight is 190 (fit ). Was 200 about ten+ years ago then first ten years gained 20 lbs.   and then last November gained 10 lbs on an SSRI and even tho I switched out of it and stopped overeating the gains are staying.    Thanks again', 'Rybelsus: Week 1. I started the 3mg Rybelsus oral tablet on 11/09/2022. The following are stats on the first week on this dosage:  Personal: female/ 25 y.o./ 5\'5""/ CW: 241 lbs, SW: 247.4 Total weight loss: 6.4 lbs I am not diabetic, I was given the Rybelsus 3mg trial packs by my Dr/ PA as a foot into the door for weightloss.  Day 1: took the pill in the am with just a sip of water and waited about an hour to eat (you only need to wait for 30 minutes; however, I noticed that when I wake up in the am I am very hungry and if I wait just over an hour after taking the pill the hunger is gone and I can go until lunch without eating). When lunch time came around I basically eat a small snack and immediately felt the effects of the med. It was like feeling the ""fullness"" que for the 1st time in my adult life. I had to remind myself to drink water throughout the day. When Dinner came I experience the same thing as lunch, a few bites in and I was done!  Evert day this week has been very similar. When ever I wake up I pop the pill with just a sip of water- wait about an hour to see if I\'m still hungry or not (usually I am not, buy if I am [1] granola bar did the trick- which is crazy because I used to be the person thinking ""how can anyone just eat one of these?"" And now I am one of those people who eats half of it and saves the other half for later). The pill hasn\'t taken my need to be snacky away; however, I will snack on healthier options. And what was once snacking on 4 or 5 bigger items (i.e. popcorn, fruit, crackers, and some chocolate) now I want two or three slices of fruit or I can only eat a handful of popcorn. As far as sweet treats go- I have had them, but I have lost my sweet tooth. 2 weeks ago I could have eaten ice cream every day for every meal, today I am just not pressed to eat sweets like that.  I know a lot of people have titrated up to 7mg after their 1st month; however, my Dr gave me three packs of the 3mg dosage and told me to start with that. Which at the moment if the weight loss continues in the same trend as it has this week, then I have no problem with that. I know everyone is different so we will just have to wait and see.  I haven\'t seen many forums of the weightloss process specifically for Rybelsus, so my goal is to update my progress on this med at least once a week. I am happy to answer any questions, comments or concerns!', ""My short experience cutting with Rybelsus 7mg (semaglutide). I wanted to see what the fuss was about and decided to get this to help with my cut due to it's apparent amazing appetite suppression. The doctor I spoke to advised 3mg doesn't do much for people so he likes to start them on 7mg and at £260 for 30 tablets I was happy I wasn't getting the weakest ones. Day 1 felt a little queasy throughout the day but it seemed to ease up in the afternoon and onwards. Similar on day 2 in the morning but felt fine as the day went on and I was able to get a good workout in that evening. Day 3-5 no nausea but my energy wasn't the best, physically I didn't feel too bad but mentally I didn't want to do anything. It was a strange feeling. During the first 5 days I was able to keep calories to 1100-1300 a day and lost 11.4lbs. I wasn't feeling full apart from after my dinner each night but instead of my hunger being like 7-8 it was like 3/10 but I still felt that slightly weak/sick feeling you get when you're starving and your stomach hurts from it. Day 6 felt like shit all day and very nauseous. Really wanted to work out and my body felt OK but it's like my brain was telling me not to and just lie down all day. I eventually managed a small workout in the evening but it difficult. Day 7 (today I woke up feeling good, took my tablet then went to the supermarket and had some fruit and instantly had to throw it up, and it was also brining up food from the night before that still hadn't digested yet. I had about 5 rounds of vomiting before it eventually stopped and my throat felt like it was on fire. Decided at that point it wasn't worth continuing my tablets but thankfully started feeling a lot better after being sick. Cut to dinner time and as soon as I'm finished I can feel that I'm gonna throw up again. Tried to hold it off but wasn't going to work so I ran to the bathroom and luckily got most in the toilet but by rounds 3-4 I tilted my head up thinking it was over then projectile vomited all up my walls and bathroom scales. Not going to chance anymore food tonight. I've definitely came to the conclusion it's better to be hungry and deal with that while cutting rather than feel nauseous and having to projectile vomit after meals. Everyone's body reacts differentely but I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who only wants to use it for cutting like I did. It just isn't worth it.""]"

Have any T1s ever had to switch from Victoza to another one of these drugs? I'm acclimated to Victoza, as a T1, and doing extremely well with it. It took me a couple of months of terrible symptoms to ramp up to the full dose.   My insurance package with my new job (thanks benefit managers for the bait and switch /s) excludes Victoza from their formulary. All of our Rx are through Express Scripts, so (and I would appreciate it if someone corrects me if I am wrong) I believe I would not be able to use drugmaker coupons, plus, even with a prior authorization or a letter of medical necessity, I would be responsible for the entire cost of the monthly 3-pack and covered at 0% for this drug.   For others who have switched from Victoza to other GLP-1 agonists, how was your experience? Did you go through another round of side effects? How severe? (I would not have been able to fulfill current my travel-heavy, collaboration-heavy, crazy-schedule position with the side effects I experienced first acclimating to Victoza, hence my concern.) Were your blood sugars as well controlled? Did you notice any other differences?   Thank you so much for taking a moment to share. "", 'Recently diagnosed type 2 in the last six months and prescribed Victoza (experiences?). Back in January I was diagnosed with as a type 2 diabetic. I\'m in my late 20s and just had a baby last year. When I got pregnant I was 110 lbs and didn\'t put on any weight til the last 6 weeks. Then I jumped to 160. I was kept in the intermediate ICU in the hospital for a month after delivery because of cardiac issues. (I woke up a flight of steps and my bpm skyrocketed to 200s). When I left I was 200 lbs and I haven\'t been able to lose any weight. I scheduled an appointment and got a bunch of blood work done and he told me I had ""fatty liver"", type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol.   He said that if I didn\'t get it in check now by the time I am 35 my chance of a heart attack will be 50% (my family has history of heart failure young) and my liver would get worse. So I was prescribed pravastatin, victoza, and given handouts on healthy eating.  My question is about Victoza. He said take 1.2 mg but if I was nauseous to try the lower dose of 0.6 mg and then slowly go up. But it makes me extremely nauseous. I\'ve read so many stories about success stories. Even my primary when I told her she was like ""wow, yeah it\'s an amazing medication !""  Granted I wasn\'t eating well while taking it. I take public transportation everyday and it\'s an hour and half each way. I was grabbing food from Dunkin Donuts or eating nothing at all in the morning. Recently I have been bringing two yogurts with me instead of a honey bun. So maybe if I try Victoza again and eat right with it then my nausea won\'t be as bad?   Let me know your experiences, because I don\'t want to end up in insulin if I don\'t have too. My sugars with it was 90-120 but without was 130-240. Last month when I was hospitalized for pneumonia they didn\'t have Victoza so they gave me Novolog when needed. Suprisngly I needed it almost every meal. At home I don\'t check my sugars every few hours, honestly I might only once a day. (I know..,) but any feedback would be appreciated. Even if it\'s negative because I probably deserve it.     Update: last night I took 0.6 mg of Victoza. Bad mistake. I woke today horribly nauseous. Tried showering and spent an hour sweating so bad I couldn\'t pull on pants. I\'ve been sober for a year on methadone and by the time I took public transportation to the clinic I was feeling worse. Five minutes after getting dosed I spent 20 mins vomiting and reaching bile. Then instead of feeling better from throwing up I felt worse. The whole bus ride home I didn\'t think I\'d make it. When I jumped off the bus spent another 15 minutes throwing up bile. I\'d rather be fat and feel good then live like this.', 'What is your least favorite drug, and why?. Title pretty much says it all. Only thing I\'d like to add is that you *explain* WHY you do not like this particular medication. I think right now it is safe to say that anything on backorder shouldn\'t count, as this is a temporal problem. C2s have always been a PITA, so share your story if you got it - though I think it would be more interesting to see non C2s. Feel free to bend the rules, I ain\'t the boss.  With that being said, I would have to say Ambien/Zolpidem. I understand it is already controlled and all and early refills are not allowed, but it seems no physician practices dosing women at 5mg at first and are used almost every night, not just for a two week period (per guidelines). Maybe quantity limits of #30 per 90 days would help? No idea.  Is that enough to hate it? No, not really. But I find some of my nastiest patients are only nasty regarding their zolpidem, and without a doubt I get more people requesting a two week early fill as they\'ll be on vacation (where we have pharmacies they could pick up at, nonetheless). And need it in an hour as they have a plane to catch.  All that being said, the medication does work wonders for insomnia, and it being a no-go pill for the military [pilots] allows some rest; how much more, I do not know. In my opinion, more strict dispensing should happen; of course, exceptions should be made for legitimate reasons.  Quick fun story, but when Ambien was just being introduced to PBMs and other folks, a conference was held to introduce medical professionals to the benefits of ambien. They (Searle?) gave out free samples for the 4-5 day resort style conference (how, I have no idea how that wasn\'t legal) to participants - 15 tablets. One of my buddies was there. Let\'s just say, many C-suite and upper management either were straight up fired or received notice that they were on thin ice. If iPhones existed back then, I think punishments would be much more severe.  Some examples of behavior was:  1. A C-suite went to her room around 9pm, popped an ambien as she had ""an hour or so"" and went to meet a friend. She then came back to the bar/lobby and removed her top, told people to go fuck themselves, tried to buy a round for the WHOLE hotel at the bar, then ran to the ocean to escape security. not good. 2. An executive ordered $5,000 of room service to the wrong room on accident, and once figuring it out, he went to that room and was very sexually inappropriate to the the women staying there. He remembers nothing; he was found 15 miles away at a completely different hotel, having checked in the night before and everything.Rumor has it a very mad boyfriend bound him up, drove him out there naked, and tied raw meat to his body. 3. A junior level marketer thought it would be funny after taking two tablets to allude to the fact that he had a gun and wanted to see some action. Police were called of course; charges included resisting arrest, battery on a peace officer, intoxicated in public, hate speech against a protected group, and property damage over $10k. Before this, everyone in the company thought he was a very relaxed guy, very nice, spoke out against racism, and was honorable. Bye bye, job. 4. Last but not least, A man took 30mg and got lost in the hotel, then walked ~3km to the nearest bigger city. He stopped at a pub for a beer, and then, remembers nothing after that. Well, CCTV showed him buying and doing cocaine in the bar (tox confirmed it), saw a handful of men yelling at each other and told them to shut up - only they were two gangs and immediately put aside their differences and stole almost $900 in cash and all credit cards after a good \'ol beat down.. He spent the night in jail after getting apprehended for public urination, vandalism, and other misdemeanors.  &#x200B;  TLDR: I think the public uses this medication daily, and many do not know that many find out the hard way when they wake up in jail after trying to get a Big Mac at 2am. Our [USA] sleeping pills aren\'t the best, and it comes as a shock how potent it is. I picked a pretty easy one, but it truly is one of my least favorites to dispense. What are some of yours?']"

So, I\'ve posted on here before by here\'s as brief as I can be about my whole Calibrate saga in case these things are of interest to anyone else.  **Calibrate Experience**  I was an OG member back in 2020 and I really enjoyed the program, support and coaching. My insurance wouldn\'t play ball, though, and there were no medication options for me, so Calibrate proactively offered to refund most of my cost (I did not have to ask), with a small charge for the doctor\'s appointments and the coaching I had done.   I changed insurance last June and realized that with a history of pre-diabetes and at the weight I was, Calibrate would likely be able to get me medication, so I rejoined and within about 4 weeks I had done my labs and had my doctor\'s appointment. All of that was going very smoothly. The medical channel messaged me proactively and let me know that their first choice med wasn\'t going to be an option, and they put me on Mounjaro with the coupon. I got my first box about 6 weeks after my doctor\'s appointment via PillPack in early October. This seemed reasonable to me at the time and within what they told me to expect.  Then I started following all the drama with the Mounjaro savings card. On 10/26, I messaged the support channel asking them to try and get a prior auth for something else at that time because not knowing when I would have to go off the meds was stressing me out (GLP-1s help greatly with my IBS AND I need them for pre-diabetes - weight loss is just the easiest reason for me to access this class of medicine). I received a canned response but no one actually responded or did anything at that time. I followed up a month later on 11/29 and still received absolutely no human response. Then we all got the dreaded email from PillPack on like 12/7 I think about the Mounjaro card. I reached out AGAIN with the original options I had researched back in August - Saxenda being the most promising, but Rybelsus also being one that I could potentially be put on with documentation of my pre-diabetes and meformin failure. I even asked my GI to write up a quick note about why I can\'t be on metformin and offered to submit that to them. No response to any of my specific communication about my specific circumstances.  Calibrate submitted a PA for Mounjaro on 12/8. It was denied on 12/10. I did not receive any communication about that, but I did see it in my health portal. When I received the denial in the mail, it said that the PA was submitted for ""obesity"" which I found annoying because there was no way my insurance was going to approve a PA for that reason with that med. I wrote Calibrate and told them if they wanted to try to get me on mounjaro, it would be better to use a dx of pre-diabetes and use the documentation I kept offering them. I got a VERY SNIPPY canned response basically asking me to stop contacting them about meds and wait. So I did.  On 12/16, I received word that they\'d submitted a prescription for Trulicity for me. That hadn\'t come up in my research but I figured they had done the legwork at that point and knew it would get approved.  It did not get approved. Instead, the prescription sat at Pillpack for almost a month. Pillpack got in touch with my multiple times saying they were waiting for documentation of step therapy from Calibrate (which, again, I offered to give them) and they had gotten no response.  **It was very clear at that point that Calibrate was running some kind of playbook and not taking my specific medical situation (which could help with PAs and such) into consideration AT ALL.**  I complained to the [insurance-questions@joincalibrate.com](mailto:insurance-questions@joincalibrate.com) alias telling them that they should have tried getting a PA for Saxenda or run the Mounjaro PA differently, and FINALLY received a very general response from an escalation coordinator on 1/6 saying they would work on it. I got nothing else describing any kind of specific action they were taking.  Finally, on 1/8 I met with a Join Mochi doctor, who asked me for all my research, got my documentation of previous failure on Metformin and wrote a script for Saxenda and said he was prepared to work on a PA. On 1/10 I got an automated message from my insurance company saying my PA for Saxenda had been approved, which at first I thought was all Mochi\'s doing. It turns out that Calibrate did this, they submitted the PA on 1/9 (2.5 months after my initial message on 10/29 asking them to do this). So they got the PA approved, but then did nothing with it. Pillpack is still sitting on the Trulicity prescription they can\'t fulfill. I have Saxenda in hand because the Mochi doctor wrote the script literally 2 minutes after I talked to him, and he was prepared to work on the PA, though it turned out Calibrate had actually done that much.  On 1/14 (a Saturday), I received a message from Calibrate saying the PA had been approved (which I had known for 4 days at that point). I messaged back and said ""I don\'t want you to write a script, I have the meds in hand already."" I got a response telling me I wouldn\'t get a refund if I cancelled. I said I did not care, could they please confirm they weren\'t going to do ANYTHING ELSE on my behalf because they sucked at it. I have yet to receive a response. I cc\'d two email addresses (support and membership) AND wrote the same in the support channel at the same time.  While THAT all was happening, the coach I had initially left (was laid off? it seemed to happen somewhat suddenly as I had a session cancelled and rescheduled) and I was given a new coach who seemed nice enough, but she met with me once initially, and then on our second meeting acted like it was our first meeting, and when I pointed out that we\'d met before she seemed frazzled and stressed and apologized. Then she was on PTO, which is fair enough. People are entitled to PTO, and I had a sub coach who also seemed stressed and frazzled. Then I had my coaching session fall on Thanksgiving, which was cancelled and not pushed or rescheduled and THEN my subsequent coaching session cancelled suddenly because my coach was out for medical reasons and THEN had another sub coach. At that point I threw a fit in the support channel and was ""permanently"" re assigned to a new coach. When I met with THAT person in early Jan, she said ""Oh, you\'re with me permanently. Oh. They never tell me anything."" And then seemed to catch herself and walk it back at bit. I will say, my new coach is great and I am considering continuing for that aspect since I won\'t get a refund anyway.  **Mochi Experience**  On the flip side the experience with Mochi has been great. It is just telehealth, not a ""program"" and I hate the idea of paying for both for 6 months if I can\'t get a refund from Calibrate (Mochi is $79/month), but the Mochi doctor has been responsive and I get unlimited appointments with a nutritionist which I am excited about. I can actually email my doctor which is awesome and see him 1x/month or less if I prefer. I will say getting an appointment with the nutritionist hasn\'t happened as fast as I would like, but a much better experience so far, and my nutrition appointment is booked for early Feb. Supposedly that is a longer appointment where I\'ll get customized recommendations that work for me, which should be great.  There is no Mochi app or medication tracking, which is a downside but I think they are working on it as they are relatively new. They also prescribe more than just GLP-1s if you are open to other medication options.  &#x200B;  Tl;dr: Calibrate is running a playbook on the meds and isn\'t really doing any kind of individual consultation or working with your specific situation.

It is just telehealth, not a ""program"" and I hate the idea of paying for both for 6 months if I can\'t get a refund from Calibrate (Mochi is $79/month), but the Mochi doctor has been responsive and I get unlimited appointments with a nutritionist which I am excited about. I can actually email my doctor which is awesome and see him 1x/month or less if I prefer. I will say getting an appointment with the nutritionist hasn\'t happened as fast as I would like, but a much better experience so far, and my nutrition appointment is booked for early Feb. Supposedly that is a longer appointment where I\'ll get customized recommendations that work for me, which should be great.  There is no Mochi app or medication tracking, which is a downside but I think they are working on it as they are relatively new.

Mochi has at least worked with my specific situation in a much more efficient way.', 'Calibrate -> Mochi Experience (long). So, I\'ve posted on here before by here\'s as brief as I can be about my whole Calibrate saga in case these things are of interest to anyone else.  **Calibrate Experience**  I was an OG member back in 2020 and I really enjoyed the program, support and coaching. My insurance wouldn\'t play ball, though, and there were no medication options for me, so Calibrate proactively offered to refund most of my cost (I did not have to ask), with a small charge for the doctor\'s appointments and the coaching I had done.   I changed insurance last June and realized that with a history of pre-diabetes and at the weight I was, Calibrate would likely be able to get me medication, so I rejoined and within about 4 weeks I had done my labs and had my doctor\'s appointment. All of that was going very smoothly. The medical channel messaged me proactively and let me know that their first choice med wasn\'t going to be an option, and they put me on Mounjaro with the coupon. I got my first box about 6 weeks after my doctor\'s appointment via PillPack in early October. This seemed reasonable to me at the time and within what they told me to expect.  Then I started following all the drama with the Mounjaro savings card. On 10/26, I messaged the support channel asking them to try and get a prior auth for something else at that time because not knowing when I would have to go off the meds was stressing me out (GLP-1s help greatly with my IBS AND I need them for pre-diabetes - weight loss is just the easiest reason for me to access this class of medicine). I received a canned response but no one actually responded or did anything at that time. I followed up a month later on 11/29 and still received absolutely no human response. Then we all got the dreaded email from PillPack on like 12/7 I think about the Mounjaro card. I reached out AGAIN with the original options I had researched back in August - Saxenda being the most promising, but Rybelsus also being one that I could potentially be put on with documentation of my pre-diabetes and meformin failure. I even asked my GI to write up a quick note about why I can\'t be on metformin and offered to submit that to them. No response to any of my specific communication about my specific circumstances.  Calibrate submitted a PA for Mounjaro on 12/8. It was denied on 12/10. I did not receive any communication about that, but I did see it in my health portal. When I received the denial in the mail, it said that the PA was submitted for ""obesity"" which I found annoying because there was no way my insurance was going to approve a PA for that reason with that med. I wrote Calibrate and told them if they wanted to try to get me on mounjaro, it would be better to use a dx of pre-diabetes and use the documentation I kept offering them. I got a VERY SNIPPY canned response basically asking me to stop contacting them about meds and wait. So I did.  On 12/16, I received word that they\'d submitted a prescription for Trulicity for me. That hadn\'t come up in my research but I figured they had done the legwork at that point and knew it would get approved.  It did not get approved. Instead, the prescription sat at Pillpack for almost a month. Pillpack got in touch with my multiple times saying they were waiting for documentation of step therapy from Calibrate (which, again, I offered to give them) and they had gotten no response.  **It was very clear at that point that Calibrate was running some kind of playbook and not taking my specific medical situation (which could help with PAs and such) into consideration AT ALL.**  I complained to the [insurance-questions@joincalibrate.com](mailto:insurance-questions@joincalibrate.com) alias telling them that they should have tried getting a PA for Saxenda or run the Mounjaro PA differently, and FINALLY received a very general response from an escalation coordinator on 1/6 saying they would work on it. I got nothing else describing any kind of specific action they were taking.  Finally, on 1/8 I met with a Join Mochi doctor, who asked me for all my research, got my documentation of previous failure on Metformin and wrote a script for Saxenda and said he was prepared to work on a PA. On 1/10 I got an automated message from my insurance company saying my PA for Saxenda had been approved, which at first I thought was all Mochi\'s doing. It turns out that Calibrate did this, they submitted the PA on 1/9 (2.5 months after my initial message on 10/29 asking them to do this). So they got the PA approved, but then did nothing with it. Pillpack is still sitting on the Trulicity prescription they can\'t fulfill. I have Saxenda in hand because the Mochi doctor wrote the script literally 2 minutes after I talked to him, and he was prepared to work on the PA, though it turned out Calibrate had actually done that much.  On 1/14 (a Saturday), I received a message from Calibrate saying the PA had been approved (which I had known for 4 days at that point). I messaged back and said ""I don\'t want you to write a script, I have the meds in hand already."" I got a response telling me I wouldn\'t get a refund if I cancelled. I said I did not care, could they please confirm they weren\'t going to do ANYTHING ELSE on my behalf because they sucked at it. I have yet to receive a response. I cc\'d two email addresses (support and membership) AND wrote the same in the support channel at the same time.  While THAT all was happening, the coach I had initially left (was laid off? it seemed to happen somewhat suddenly as I had a session cancelled and rescheduled) and I was given a new coach who seemed nice enough, but she met with me once initially, and then on our second meeting acted like it was our first meeting, and when I pointed out that we\'d met before she seemed frazzled and stressed and apologized. Then she was on PTO, which is fair enough. People are entitled to PTO, and I had a sub coach who also seemed stressed and frazzled. Then I had my coaching session fall on Thanksgiving, which was cancelled and not pushed or rescheduled and THEN my subsequent coaching session cancelled suddenly because my coach was out for medical reasons and THEN had another sub coach. At that point I threw a fit in the support channel and was ""permanently"" re assigned to a new coach. When I met with THAT person in early Jan, she said ""Oh, you\'re with me permanently. Oh.

As an alternative, he's suggesting Saxenda which would be short-term until Wegovy becomes widely available again. I'm hesitant about frequently switching meds, so I'd prefer to start/stay on Wegovy since it should be easily available again in the 1st quarter, hopefully.

Also of note, many doctors are not comfortable prescribing medication for weight due to [long standing stigma]( For those looking, happy to help you vet an in-person or weight loss provider with the appropriate credentials. This is just a passion project of mine, and something I\'ve personally struggled with.   For each of these, I\'ll walk through a brief overview of the mechanism, landmark trials showing evidence it works and in what population, and side effects/side effect rates**. Noting what the placebo group did and comparing to the medications is also important.**   Weight loss PILLS on the other hand (supplements, anything on amazon or Instagram/Facebook ads) are a whole different story, and should be avoided (more on this later).   Obesity Medicine is a relatively new specialty with many medications in its toolkit. ([ABOM](   **Liraglutide (Victoza/Saxenda)**   *How it Works:* Liraglutide is a GLP-1 medication that was created for Type 2 Diabetes. By acting on GLP-1 receptors, your body is tricked into producing more leptin/less ghrelin, and feeling full. These receptors also delay the rate your stomach empties, making you feel full longer after a meal.   [The Lancet Trial]( showed that when compared to placebo, Liraglutide had 7.6% weight loss (placebo 2.3%) while Semaglutide had between 6-13.8% weight loss over 52 weeks. Everyone including placebo group in this study was asked to eat 500kcal below TDEE and was seen every 2 weeks for weeks 0-20 and every 4 weeks after until 52 weeks, and 150 min exercise/week was recommended.   [SCALE Trial:]( 12 weeks, in Type 2 Diabetics: Liraglutide had 4.7-6.0% weight loss (placebo 2.0%) over 12 weeks. 500kcal deficit with 150min/week exercise.   *Down Sides:* The biggest side effect is nausea, vomiting, and GI distress reported between 17-38% [depending on the dosage]( Additionally, many, many insurances do not cover this medication for non-diabetics, and out of pocket it costs roughly $1000-$1200 per month. Victoza and Saxenda are injectables.   *Scary:* GLP-1 receptors are also in the Thyroid. There has been some evidence that both Liraglutide and Semaglutide [can increase risk of a rare thyroid c-cell cancer.]( There\'s also evidence it increases risk of gallstones and pancreatitis.   **Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus)**   *Same mechanism* as Liraglutide, but reformulated as a more potent version, and higher reported weight loss. Again the same Down sides and Scary side effects as Liraglutide.   The STEP Trials were done to prove the efficacy of semaglutide for weight loss:[STEP 3]( showed that over 68 weeks, patients on 2.4mg Semaglutide lose 16.0% weight (5.7% Placebo). Impressively, 75% lost 10% or more, and 55% lost 15% or more over 68 weeks.   Of note: this study had the most intense placebo group I\'ve ever seen. Take those high % with a grain of salt, given the exercise/diet regimen patients were on. For 8 weeks, everyone received Nutrisystem meal replacement at 1000-1200 cal/day. Then, patients transitioned to 1200-1800cal/day hypo-caloric diet for the remaining weeks. Everyone started on 100min exercise/week, increasing over 4 months by 25 min/week to 200min/week. They also had 30 individual dietician sessions over 68 weeks to walk through their diet and exercise.   *Down Sides:* See above  *Scary:* See above. This one is more expenseive ($1400/month sans insurance). You should be able to get coverage if you are T2 Diabetic, however.   **Phentermine (Adipex, Lomira, Qsymia (combo with Topiramate))**  *How it works:* Phentermine is a substituted amphetamine, meaning that in some ways it looks like an amphetamine but a [far, far milder, less addictive]( and safer version. It has way less ""stimulant"" effect and more appetite suppression. It primarily works by decreasing appetite, decreasing the caloric intake of patients and thus, making it easier to maintain a caloric deficit. It by itself does not cause weight loss, and increases in metabolism are minimal, if any. However, given its similarity, it is Schedule IV drug and cannot be taken concurrently with other stimulants/medications that could increase blood pressure.   The topic of whether phentermine increases blood pressure or is ""bad for the heart"" has been extensively discussed and the conclusion is no. While many people remember ""fen-phen"" in the 80s and 90s, the ""fen"" that caused heart valve side effects was fenfluramine (recalled in the 90s), which is no longer mixed with phentermine. [Phentermine has actually shown to decrease blood pressure long term, given its impact on weight loss]( It has no cardiovascular risk, in short or long term use. This is generally the most prescribed drug by obesity medicine providers, given it has been around since the 60s, is well-tolerated and generic (~$25/month)   Phentermine alone has shown upto 7.5% weight loss when used long term [(24 months)]( in retrospective studies. When combined with Topiramate (either prescribed alone or as a combo med Qsymia) there are two large scale studies [CONQUER]( and [SEQUEL]( patients lost between 9.3-10.5% (1.2% for placebo).   The placebo group in this study was given a LEARN manual on what foods to eat, seen every 4 weeks (including an extra visit at week 2 for dose adjustment), and instructed to reduce their caloric intake by 500kcal/day.   *Down Sides:* Most people have some degree of dry mouth with this medication (salivary gland activity decreased due to sympathetic nervous system activation). Insomnia and constipation are also common (~30%).   *Scary:* If you have a known history of substance use disorder, particularly with amphetamines, this medication is not for you. Given there is a theoretical risk of increased blood pressure, its not the first medication to prescribe for patients with history of arrhythmia.   **Topiramate (Topamax, Qsymia)**   *How it works:* See above for more information on Qsymia combination. Topiramate\'s mechanism for causing weight loss is similar to Phentermine in that it acts on GABA receptors to decrease appetite. In and of itself, it doesn\'t change your metabolism. It is a tool to make it easier to eat at a caloric deficit.   On Topiramate alone, patients lost approximately [3.9% within 3 months and 7.3% at 1 year]( in patients taking the medication for epilepsy. Given its risk of kidney stones, very important to drink lots and lots of water on this medication!   Good news is, it is generic and pretty cheap (~$25/month, depending on your pharmacy/dosage)  *Down Sides*: Pins and needles tingling sensation (mostly in toes, sometimes other areas as well) (~30%), Taste changes (8-15% depending on dosage), fatigue. Not recommended as first medication for those with history of kidney stones, or epilepsy. Can\'t stop taking abruptly, as it can cause seizures.   *Scary:* Hair loss (alopecia) in about 1-4%. Memory change/confusion usually described as ""brain fog""– not recommended for elderly, also rare.   **Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Contrave (combo with Naltrexone))**   *How it works:* Bupropion was developed as an antidepressant. Your brain naturally releases Norepinephrine and Dopamine to send signals shooting down your neurons. After a while, the hormones are taken back up to be released next time. This medication blocks re-uptake, allowing signaling to continue. Low levels of dopamine have been associated with increased hunger, so by increasing dopamine signaling, you will have less appetite/cravings. Again, this doesn\'t inherently increase metabolism, it just decreases appetite and improves mood for those who are struggling with both weight and depression. Good news is its also pretty cheap! (generic $~15/month)   [In this trial of obese patients:]( group lost 5%, bupropion group lost 7.2-10.1% over 24 weeks (based on dosage). Placebo group had an intro dietician visit and was provided a meal plan that recommended Slim Fast for 24 weeks, and 1 slim fast per day for the last 24 weeks (was not provided to patients, just recommended).   [In this trial of obese patients with depression]( patients lost 4.6% on bupropion vs 1.8% placebo (500kcal deficit) over 26 weeks. They also had <=50% depressive symptoms on medication.   *Down Sides:* Most common side effects reported [between 11-17% are dry mouth, headache, nausea, insomnia (need to take in AM!) constipation, dizziness.](  *Scary:* 0.4% of patients will have seizures on this medication at doses over 300XR, and rates increase with higher doses above this- this is still quite rare.   **Naltrexone (Contrave, ReVia, Vitrol)**   *How it works:* Naltrexone was originally created for substance use disorder, as it is an opioid receptor antagonist. However, it is now broadly used for other use disorders (tobacco, alcohol, binge eating disorder) as its been shown to decrease cravings overall in your brain\'s reward pathway. Its pretty cheap when prescribed alone as a generic, but Contrave combo is branded + expensive. You can get naltrexone/bupropion individually as generics for less.   There isn\'t much benefit when given alone, so its primarily prescribed with Bupropion (either as Contrave combo or both pills as generics).   [Contrave: the combo of naltrexone/bupropion]( has been studied in a few trials to cause between 6.7-8.1% weight loss (1.8% placebo- mild hypocaloric diet and exercise), and in another trial 11.5% (7.3% placebo, with intense hypocaloric diet/exercise regimen).   *Down Sides:* Most commonly reported side effect is [nausea (~30%)]( with headache, constipation in the ~10%   *Scary:* If you are concurrently using opioids, this will put you into withdrawal and can lead to opioid withdrawal symptoms. It should not be used in patients with seizure disorder due to a risk of increasing seizures.   **Orlistat (Alli, Xenical)**   *How it works*: Orlistat was made for weight loss: it directly works on your pancreatic lipase cells to literally block the breakdown and thus absorption of fats in your diet. Sounds like a miracle right? Unfortunately, it blocks ALL fats, and has multiple times/day dosing.   Blocking all fats means there is a risk of vitamin deficiencies when taken long term, or in those already deficient (vitamin D, E, A, K). It also means many patients struggle with the very common side effects of fats in their stool/flatulence, foul smelling gas, etc. [Patients lost about 5.17% vs 2.75% with placebo](  *Down Sides:* Taken 120mg three times per day. Expensive, but over the counter (Alli) ~$150/month.   *Scary:* Due to its mechanism on fats, it can lead to [increase risk of gallstones.](   **Metformin**   How it works: Metformin is primarily used as a mainstay treatment for T2DM. It has been shown to help some patients lose weight as well, although mostly PCOS patients.[Studies really vary on this,]( most suggest modest weight loss of around 2.9kg vs 0.8kg placebo (minimal intervention). However, this weight loss is sustained long term, and the medication has other benefits on preventing progression of prediabetes -> diabetes, and controlling A1C.   Down Sides: Most patients complain of [GI distress]( (nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, flatulence) ~20-40%.   Scary: Very rare, but some cases of lactic acidosis (kidney problem).   **Plenity (cellulose and citric acid combo) aka Gelesis100**  *How it works:* This is a new medication that actually went through something tricky with FDA-cleared vs FDA-approved. Because it was approved as a ""medical device"" rather than a prescription medication, its approval process was slightly different.   You know that feeling when you\'ve eaten a large salad and your stomach feels full from the sheer volume of leafy greens you ate? That feeling is from cellulose in leafy greens that is indigestible, but makes you feel very full. That\'s what this is trying to mimic, its a cellulose/citric acid pill that expands with water in your stomach. You take this pill   There\'s really only 1 study that\'s been done on this, funded by Roman (you might know them as the ED company) [the GLOW Trial]( which showed patients lost 6.4% vs 4.4% for placebo (a difference of only 2.2%) over 24 weeks. Its 3 2.25g capsules (big pills!) taken with 500mL water (2 cups of water) 20-30 minutes before dinner. These pills expand with water and make you feel full at meal times so you eat less.   *Down Sides:* Poor evidence it really works, about $100/month. [Given that just 500ml water at meal times has been shown to decrease caloric consumption by almost 200kcal/day]( and the same weight reduction, doesn\'t really have good data to support the medication!   *Scary:* Do not take this if you have had vertical sleeve gastrectomy, or at least talk to your PCP first! You have a smaller stomach after surgery, and the expanding gel pills could cause perforation/expansion.   **Summary Table:**   |**Medication**|**% weight loss - % placebo**|**Oral/Injectable/Dosing**|**Price for 1 month**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Liraglutide|5.3%, SCALE 2.7-4%|Oral and Injectable|$1000, covered for T2DM and sometimes pre-diabetics| |Semaglutide|STEP 3: 10.3%|Oral and Injectable|$1200-$1400, covered for T2DM and some prediabetics| |Phentermine|7.5% alone, 8.1-9.3% with Topiramate|Oral, AM|$25 (Qsymia is $200)| | Topiramate|7.3% alone, 8.1-9.3% with Phentermine|Oral, PM|~$25 (Qsymia is $200)| |Bupropion|2.2-5.1% alone, 4.8-6.3% with Naltrexone|Oral, AM|~$15 (Contrave is $200-$400) | |Naltrexone|4.8-6.3% with Bupropion|Oral, AM|~$15 (Contrave is $200-$400)| |Orlistat|2.42%|Oral, 3x/day|~$150| |Metformin|~5lbs |Oral|$25| |Plenity|2.2%|Oral, 3x/day|$100|  **NOW, the other topic: Weight loss Supplements.**   Phen-Q: Primarily a caffeine pill, with B3 and capsicum. No clinical studies showing it helps lose weight.   Waist Trainers: Make your stomach sweat. They\'re marketted as a way to make your stomach lose water weight/slim. However, there\'s no evidence they do that, and [they actually decrease your lung function](  FitTeas/laxative tea: These are usually Senna based teas, a common herb-based laxative. Not only are they overpriced, but chronic senna use leads to [melanosis coli!]( Also scary, [chronic use can lead to cyclic edema– ie. this case](   B12/Lipotropic shots: No evidence it helps with weight loss unless you have a clinical lab finding showing deficiency. Even then, oral therapy is usually enough. For patients who have had gastric bypass, [deficiency is common and should be checked on labs BEFORE starting therapy.](', 'A Comprehensive Guide to Prescription weight medications.  ***Controversial topic incoming!*** **New MD (\'22) here!** I know that many people who are looking to lose weight would prefer a natural option without medication.

On Topiramate alone, patients lost approximately [3.9% within 3 months and 7.3% at 1 year]( in patients taking the medication for epilepsy. Given its risk of kidney stones, very important to drink lots and lots of water on this medication!   Good news is, it is generic and pretty cheap (~$25/month, depending on your pharmacy/dosage)  *Down Sides*: Pins and needles tingling sensation (mostly in toes, sometimes other areas as well) (~30%), Taste changes (8-15% depending on dosage), fatigue. Not recommended as first medication for those with history of kidney stones, or epilepsy. Can\'t stop taking abruptly, as it can cause seizures.   *Scary:* Hair loss (alopecia) in about 1-4%. Memory change/confusion usually described as ""brain fog""– not recommended for elderly, also rare.   **Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Contrave (combo with Naltrexone))**   *How it works:* Bupropion was developed as an antidepressant. Your brain naturally releases Norepinephrine and Dopamine to send signals shooting down your neurons. After a while, the hormones are taken back up to be released next time. This medication blocks re-uptake, allowing signaling to continue. Low levels of dopamine have been associated with increased hunger, so by increasing dopamine signaling, you will have less appetite/cravings. Again, this doesn\'t inherently increase metabolism, it just decreases appetite and improves mood for those who are struggling with both weight and depression. Good news is its also pretty cheap! (generic $~15/month)   [In this trial of obese patients:]( group lost 5%, bupropion group lost 7.2-10.1% over 24 weeks (based on dosage). Placebo group had an intro dietician visit and was provided a meal plan that recommended Slim Fast for 24 weeks, and 1 slim fast per day for the last 24 weeks (was not provided to patients, just recommended).   [In this trial of obese patients with depression]( patients lost 4.6% on bupropion vs 1.8% placebo (500kcal deficit) over 26 weeks. They also had <=50% depressive symptoms on medication.   *Down Sides:* Most common side effects reported [between 11-17% are dry mouth, headache, nausea, insomnia (need to take in AM!) constipation, dizziness.](  *Scary:* 0.4% of patients will have seizures on this medication at doses over 300XR, and rates increase with higher doses above this- this is still quite rare.   **Naltrexone (Contrave, ReVia, Vitrol)**   *How it works:* Naltrexone was originally created for substance use disorder, as it is an opioid receptor antagonist. However, it is now broadly used for other use disorders (tobacco, alcohol, binge eating disorder) as its been shown to decrease cravings overall in your brain\'s reward pathway. Its pretty cheap when prescribed alone as a generic, but Contrave combo is branded + expensive. You can get naltrexone/bupropion individually as generics for less.   There isn\'t much benefit when given alone, so its primarily prescribed with Bupropion (either as Contrave combo or both pills as generics).   [Contrave: the combo of naltrexone/bupropion]( has been studied in a few trials to cause between 6.7-8.1% weight loss (1.8% placebo- mild hypocaloric diet and exercise), and in another trial 11.5% (7.3% placebo, with intense hypocaloric diet/exercise regimen).   *Down Sides:* Most commonly reported side effect is [nausea (~30%)]( with headache, constipation in the ~10%   *Scary:* If you are concurrently using opioids, this will put you into withdrawal and can lead to opioid withdrawal symptoms. It should not be used in patients with seizure disorder due to a risk of increasing seizures.   **Orlistat (Alli, Xenical)**   *How it works*: Orlistat was made for weight loss: it directly works on your pancreatic lipase cells to literally block the breakdown and thus absorption of fats in your diet. Sounds like a miracle right? Unfortunately, it blocks ALL fats, and has multiple times/day dosing.   Blocking all fats means there is a risk of vitamin deficiencies when taken long term, or in those already deficient (vitamin D, E, A, K). It also means many patients struggle with the very common side effects of fats in their stool/flatulence, foul smelling gas, etc. [Patients lost about 5.17% vs 2.75% with placebo](  *Down Sides:* Taken 120mg three times per day. Expensive, but over the counter (Alli) ~$150/month.   *Scary:* Due to its mechanism on fats, it can lead to [increase risk of gallstones.](   **Metformin**   How it works: Metformin is primarily used as a mainstay treatment for T2DM. It has been shown to help some patients lose weight as well, although mostly PCOS patients.[Studies really vary on this,]( most suggest modest weight loss of around 2.9kg vs 0.8kg placebo (minimal intervention). However, this weight loss is sustained long term, and the medication has other benefits on preventing progression of prediabetes -> diabetes, and controlling A1C.   Down Sides: Most patients complain of [GI distress]( (nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, flatulence) ~20-40%.   Scary: Very rare, but some cases of lactic acidosis (kidney problem).   **Plenity (cellulose and citric acid combo) aka Gelesis100**  *How it works:* This is a new medication that actually went through something tricky with FDA-cleared vs FDA-approved. Because it was approved as a ""medical device"" rather than a prescription medication, its approval process was slightly different.   You know that feeling when you\'ve eaten a large salad and your stomach feels full from the sheer volume of leafy greens you ate? That feeling is from cellulose in leafy greens that is indigestible, but makes you feel very full. That\'s what this is trying to mimic, its a cellulose/citric acid pill that expands with water in your stomach. You take this pill   There\'s really only 1 study that\'s been done on this, funded by Roman (you might know them as the ED company) [the GLOW Trial]( which showed patients lost 6.4% vs 4.4% for placebo (a difference of only 2.2%) over 24 weeks. Its 3 2.25g capsules (big pills!) taken with 500mL water (2 cups of water) 20-30 minutes before dinner. These pills expand with water and make you feel full at meal times so you eat less.   *Down Sides:* Poor evidence it really works, about $100/month. [Given that just 500ml water at meal times has been shown to decrease caloric consumption by almost 200kcal/day]( and the same weight reduction, doesn\'t really have good data to support the medication!   *Scary:* Do not take this if you have had vertical sleeve gastrectomy, or at least talk to your PCP first! You have a smaller stomach after surgery, and the expanding gel pills could cause perforation/expansion.   **Summary Table:**   |**Medication**|**% weight loss - % placebo**|**Oral/Injectable/Dosing**|**Price for 1 month**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Liraglutide|5.3%, SCALE 2.7-4%|Oral and Injectable|$1000, covered for T2DM and sometimes pre-diabetics| |Semaglutide|STEP 3: 10.3%|Oral and Injectable|$1200-$1400, covered for T2DM and some prediabetics| |Phentermine|7.5% alone, 8.1-9.3% with Topiramate|Oral, AM|$25 (Qsymia is $200)| | Topiramate|7.3% alone, 8.1-9.3% with Phentermine|Oral, PM|~$25 (Qsymia is $200)| |Bupropion|2.2-5.1% alone, 4.8-6.3% with Naltrexone|Oral, AM|~$15 (Contrave is $200-$400) | |Naltrexone|4.8-6.3% with Bupropion|Oral, AM|~$15 (Contrave is $200-$400)| |Orlistat|2.42%|Oral, 3x/day|~$150| |Metformin|~5lbs |Oral|$25| |Plenity|2.2%|Oral, 3x/day|$100|  **NOW, the other topic: Weight loss Supplements.**   Phen-Q: Primarily a caffeine pill, with B3 and capsicum. No clinical studies showing it helps lose weight.   Waist Trainers: Make your stomach sweat. They\'re marketted as a way to make your stomach lose water weight/slim. However, there\'s no evidence they do that, and [they actually decrease your lung function](  FitTeas/laxative tea: These are usually Senna based teas, a common herb-based laxative. Not only are they overpriced, but chronic senna use leads to [melanosis coli!]( Also scary, [chronic use can lead to cyclic edema– ie. this case](   B12/Lipotropic shots: No evidence it helps with weight loss unless you have a clinical lab finding showing deficiency. Even then, oral therapy is usually enough. For patients who have had gastric bypass, [deficiency is common and should be checked on labs BEFORE starting therapy.](', 'A Comprehensive Guide to Prescription weight medications.  ***Controversial topic incoming!*** **New MD (\'22) here!** I know that many people who are looking to lose weight would prefer a natural option without medication. But, prescription weight loss medication from a provider you have an established relationship with IN CONJUNCTION with lifestyle changes has a higher likelihood of producing sustainable results ([AACE Guidelines]( **Taking any medication is a very personal decision,** so please take this with a grain of salt and talk to a provider you trust. Also of note, many doctors are not comfortable prescribing medication for weight due to [long standing stigma]( For those looking, happy to help you vet an in-person or weight loss provider with the appropriate credentials. This is just a passion project of mine, and something I\'ve personally struggled with.   For each of these, I\'ll walk through a brief overview of the mechanism, landmark trials showing evidence it works and in what population, and side effects/side effect rates**. Noting what the placebo group did and comparing to the medications is also important.**   Weight loss PILLS on the other hand (supplements, anything on amazon or Instagram/Facebook ads) are a whole different story, and should be avoided (more on this later).   Obesity Medicine is a relatively new specialty with many medications in its toolkit. ([ABOM](   **Liraglutide (Victoza/Saxenda)**   *How it Works:* Liraglutide is a GLP-1 medication that was created for Type 2 Diabetes. By acting on GLP-1 receptors, your body is tricked into producing more leptin/less ghrelin, and feeling full. These receptors also delay the rate your stomach empties, making you feel full longer after a meal.   [The Lancet Trial]( showed that when compared to placebo, Liraglutide had 7.6% weight loss (placebo 2.3%) while Semaglutide had between 6-13.8% weight loss over 52 weeks. Everyone including placebo group in this study was asked to eat 500kcal below TDEE and was seen every 2 weeks for weeks 0-20 and every 4 weeks after until 52 weeks, and 150 min exercise/week was recommended.   [SCALE Trial:]( 12 weeks, in Type 2 Diabetics: Liraglutide had 4.7-6.0% weight loss (placebo 2.0%) over 12 weeks. 500kcal deficit with 150min/week exercise.   *Down Sides:* The biggest side effect is nausea, vomiting, and GI distress reported between 17-38% [depending on the dosage]( Additionally, many, many insurances do not cover this medication for non-diabetics, and out of pocket it costs roughly $1000-$1200 per month. Victoza and Saxenda are injectables.   *Scary:* GLP-1 receptors are also in the Thyroid. There has been some evidence that both Liraglutide and Semaglutide [can increase risk of a rare thyroid c-cell cancer.]( There\'s also evidence it increases risk of gallstones and pancreatitis.   **Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus)**   *Same mechanism* as Liraglutide, but reformulated as a more potent version, and higher reported weight loss. Again the same Down sides and Scary side effects as Liraglutide.   The STEP Trials were done to prove the efficacy of semaglutide for weight loss:[STEP 3]( showed that over 68 weeks, patients on 2.4mg Semaglutide lose 16.0% weight (5.7% Placebo). Impressively, 75% lost 10% or more, and 55% lost 15% or more over 68 weeks.   Of note: this study had the most intense placebo group I\'ve ever seen. Take those high % with a grain of salt, given the exercise/diet regimen patients were on. For 8 weeks, everyone received Nutrisystem meal replacement at 1000-1200 cal/day. Then, patients transitioned to 1200-1800cal/day hypo-caloric diet for the remaining weeks. Everyone started on 100min exercise/week, increasing over 4 months by 25 min/week to 200min/week. They also had 30 individual dietician sessions over 68 weeks to walk through their diet and exercise.   *Down Sides:* See above  *Scary:* See above. This one is more expenseive ($1400/month sans insurance). You should be able to get coverage if you are T2 Diabetic, however.   **Phentermine (Adipex, Lomira, Qsymia (combo with Topiramate))**  *How it works:* Phentermine is a substituted amphetamine, meaning that in some ways it looks like an amphetamine but a [far, far milder, less addictive]( and safer version. It has way less ""stimulant"" effect and more appetite suppression. It primarily works by decreasing appetite, decreasing the caloric intake of patients and thus, making it easier to maintain a caloric deficit. It by itself does not cause weight loss, and increases in metabolism are minimal, if any. However, given its similarity, it is Schedule IV drug and cannot be taken concurrently with other stimulants/medications that could increase blood pressure.   The topic of whether phentermine increases blood pressure or is ""bad for the heart"" has been extensively discussed and the conclusion is no. While many people remember ""fen-phen"" in the 80s and 90s, the ""fen"" that caused heart valve side effects was fenfluramine (recalled in the 90s), which is no longer mixed with phentermine. [Phentermine has actually shown to decrease blood pressure long term, given its impact on weight loss]( It has no cardiovascular risk, in short or long term use. This is generally the most prescribed drug by obesity medicine providers, given it has been around since the 60s, is well-tolerated and generic (~$25/month)   Phentermine alone has shown upto 7.5% weight loss when used long term [(24 months)]( in retrospective studies. When combined with Topiramate (either prescribed alone or as a combo med Qsymia) there are two large scale studies [CONQUER]( and [SEQUEL]( patients lost between 9.3-10.5% (1.2% for placebo).   The placebo group in this study was given a LEARN manual on what foods to eat, seen every 4 weeks (including an extra visit at week 2 for dose adjustment), and instructed to reduce their caloric intake by 500kcal/day.   *Down Sides:* Most people have some degree of dry mouth with this medication (salivary gland activity decreased due to sympathetic nervous system activation). Insomnia and constipation are also common (~30%).   *Scary:* If you have a known history of substance use disorder, particularly with amphetamines, this medication is not for you. Given there is a theoretical risk of increased blood pressure, its not the first medication to prescribe for patients with history of arrhythmia.   **Topiramate (Topamax, Qsymia)**   *How it works:* See above for more information on Qsymia combination. Topiramate\'s mechanism for causing weight loss is similar to Phentermine in that it acts on GABA receptors to decrease appetite. In and of itself, it doesn\'t change your metabolism. It is a tool to make it easier to eat at a caloric deficit.   On Topiramate alone, patients lost approximately [3.9% within 3 months and 7.3% at 1 year]( in patients taking the medication for epilepsy. Given its risk of kidney stones, very important to drink lots and lots of water on this medication!   Good news is, it is generic and pretty cheap (~$25/month, depending on your pharmacy/dosage)  *Down Sides*: Pins and needles tingling sensation (mostly in toes, sometimes other areas as well) (~30%), Taste changes (8-15% depending on dosage), fatigue.

[   original article in spanish: [  MADRID, Spain\xa0— According to the latest evidence, the ketogenic diet is emerging as an effective strategy not only to promote weight loss, but also to manage many comorbidities associated with [obesity]( including COVID-19. This development was revealed during the 8th International Scientific Symposium New Frontiers in Scientific Research, organized by PronoKal Group and held in Barcelona, Spain. During this conference, international multidisciplinary experts in the study and management of obesity presented the latest data on the benefits of treatment based on a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet.  Ana Belén Crujeiras,\xa0BSc,\xa0PhD, principal investigator of the Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela-Galician Health Service (IDIS-SERGAS) Group of Epigenomics in Endocrinology and Nutrition and the Biomedical Research Networking Center for Obesity and Nutrition Physiopathology (CIBEROBN) commented, ""Nutritional ketosis has gained great interest in recent years because it is shown to have beneficial properties for health and promotes healthy aging, increasing longevity. Furthermore, in the case of obesity, we have more and more evidence that it is an effective treatment, mainly because to achieve this metabolic state (ketosis), routes that require the combustion of fats are activated, and this induces body weight loss  &#x200B;   The specialist stressed that several strategies are currently used to induce nutritional ketosis. They all are characterized by low carbohydrate consumption (low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet; low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet; and intermittent fasting). But Crujeiras warned that to use it as a treatment for a disease such as obesity, it must be backed by strong and solid scientific evidence, moving away from the concept of fad diets.  In this sense, since 2010, Crujeiras\' team has developed several studies focused on analyzing the efficacy and safety of treatment with a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, the results of which have been published in high-impact journals.  Crujeiras commented on the main conclusions drawn from these investigations. ""Our work has shown that the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet is effective for rapid weight loss and maintenance of lost weight, as well as reducing fat mass, primarily visceral fat mass.""  ""In this sense, a very interesting result is that despite the strong weight loss it induces, it preserves muscle mass and function and improves resting metabolic rate. These two variables are important, because all therapeutic strategies that exist to lose weight lead to a significant reduction in fat-free mass and also a reduction in energy expenditure at rest. This factor is associated with the risk of regaining lost weight, which is currently the great challenge in the treatment of obesity,"" she added.  **Specific Methylation Pattern**  Crujeiras indicated that other notable evidence is the favorable impact on an emotional and psychological level. ""To determine whether the caloric restriction of this diet and the strong weight loss that it involves were associated with an increased desire to eat, we also carried out an analysis with psychobiological tests. These results led us to conclude that this guideline is accompanied by a reduction of anxiety about food and an improvement in psychobiological parameters, thus increasing the quality of life of these patients.""  The specialist also mentioned that studies currently in progress show that the beneficial effect of this diet could be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. ""In our group, we have identified a specific DNA methylation pattern in people with obesity and we wondered if the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet would be able to reverse that methylome.  ""We [conducted a study]( in which we collected blood samples from patients on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (600 to 800 kcal/day) drawn before treatment, at peak ketosis, and at the end of treatment. After determining the global pattern of DNA in all patients with obesity targeted with this strategy and through bioinformatic analysis, we were able to obtain a methylation pattern. The results showed that after weight loss on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, the methylome that obese people initially had [was] reversed and matched that of normal-weight people.  ""Continuing with this bioinformatic analysis more comprehensively, we wanted to see what kind of genes were differentially methylated, especially by the action of the ketosis itself. We found that most of the genes that exhibited differential methylation (in total, 292 identified) belonged to pathways that were involved in the regulation of metabolism, adipose tissue function, CNS function, and also carcinogenesis,"" she continued.  **Immunomodulatory Effect**  Crujeiras commented that her research group also observed the modulatory role of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet in the functioning of the immune system, ""something that was not seen after similar weight loss induced by [bariatric surgery]( We analyzed this data in the context of the situation created by COVID-19, taking into account the evidence that people with obesity, compared to those with normal weight, have a higher risk of becoming infected and of having a poor evolution of the infection.""  In this regard, Crujeiras\' team [launched an investigation]( to study the **ACE2** gene methylation pattern, comparing obesity with normal weight and the situation after following a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet or undergoing bariatric surgery. ""We observed that the methylation pattern of this gene in obese people was increased, compared to normal weight people,"" she explained, ""and this increase was observed mainly in visceral adipose tissue. However, we did not see this in subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that visceral adipose tissue is that mostly associated with obesity-related comorbidities.  ""Likewise, the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet was associated with decreased **ACE2** methylation, along with increased exposure of this gene. However, after bariatric surgery, no significant changes were observed, so we deduce that we are protecting the patient in some way from inflammation and, therefore, from the potential of serious illness if they become infected.  ""In light of these results, we wanted to dig deeper into what was happening with the immune system of obese patients and that inflammation after a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet. We conducted a new study, currently under review in the journal **Clinical Nutrition**, with the same approach, comparing this diet with a standard hypocaloric balanced diet and bariatric surgery, in which we analyzed a wide battery of cytokines (32). We have observed a differential pattern between the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet and bariatric surgery.  ""The results confirm our hypothesis that the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet remodels the inflammatory status of obese patients, and we were also able to verify that the increase in ketone bodies has immunomodulatory properties that were previously demonstrated in preclinical and animal models, which is associated with increased immune function in these patients,"" added Crujeiras.  **Personalization and Weight Regain**  In regard to the next steps to take in the knowledge and clinical application of the benefits of this dietary strategy, Crujeiras commented that despite the fact that this diet is known to be effective, it is currently prescribed in a standard manner to all patients, ""but there is some variability in the response and also a high risk of regaining weight, as is the case with any nutritional intervention strategy, with that \'regain\' of lost weight being the main challenge in the treatment of obesity. In this sense, the epigenomic and epigenetic markers that we have identified could help us optimize treatment.""

Luca Busetto, MD, co-chair of the Obesity Management Task Force (OMTF) of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO), also insisted on the challenge posed by the individualized application of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, emphasizing that this diet always be prescribed by a doctor after an appropriate assessment of the patient. ""Obesity is not a matter of willpower or motivation, and most people with obesity have struggled their entire lives and failed because their biology tends to cause weight regain.

During his speech, Busetto presented the recent European guidelines for the management of obesity in adults with a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, endorsed by EASO, and analyzed the main strengths of these recommendations.  Busetto remarked that three important points clearly justify the use of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet. The first is the speed with which the initial weight loss occurs. Recent studies have looked at the benefits of a significant loss of excess weight early in a weight-loss diet, and although this is an association rather than a cause, the results strongly suggest that rapid initial weight loss increases the chance of the result being maintained in the long term. This clashes with the traditional recommendation of losing weight little by little as a strategy to achieve long-term results, but it must be taken into account that there are many myths in the treatment of obesity that current evidence is dismantling with new data — and this is one of them.  Secondly, the effect of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet can be added to other treatments. This has been demonstrated by studies carried out with [liraglutide]( that showed that this dietary strategy optimizes results, compared with patients who had been treated only with this drug. The third point that justifies the use of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet is the management of obesity comorbidities. Several investigations demonstrate the effectiveness of this diet in this regard, especially in the case of [type 2 diabetes]( Data suggest that the substantial weight reductions achieved with it also favor the remission of these comorbidities in many patients.  **EASO ""Approval""**  Busetto pointed out that, based on this evidence, the OMTF proposed the development of standards to be included in the EASO guidelines, since there had been no specific recommendation on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet.  ""The main objective of these European guidelines was to provide data referenced by scientific evidence and to suggest a common protocol for the use of this dietary strategy,"" he added.  For this, a very exhaustive [meta-analysis]( was carried out, researching all the publications that compared the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet with other diets. The results showed the superiority of the former method for the reduction of BMI and weight and fat mass, with no difference in lean (muscle) mass, despite significant weight loss in these patients.  This evidence also demonstrates a reduction and an improvement in metabolic markers, specifically glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism.  ""The final conclusions of the study corroborate that the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet can be recommended as an effective and safe tool for people with obesity, especially those with severe obesity or comorbidities (joint disease, preoperative period to bariatric surgery, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases) who need immediate, substantial weight loss. In addition, it can be prescribed to specific groups of patients with obesity after considering potential contraindications and under medical follow-up,"" said Busetto.  In Busetto\'s opinion, it would be convenient to refer to this approach as a method, instead of as a diet, ""because, in reality, the state of ketosis is limited in time, and if the ketogenic phase is stopped without a continuity plan, obviously weight is regained. In addition, the method approach may increase adherence by patients.""  Finally, Busetto emphasized the importance of integrating this type of treatment into a long-term lifestyle strategy (including habits, exercise, and nutritional advice).

[   original article in spanish: [  MADRID, Spain\xa0— According to the latest evidence, the ketogenic diet is emerging as an effective strategy not only to promote weight loss, but also to manage many comorbidities associated with [obesity]( including COVID-19. This development was revealed during the 8th International Scientific Symposium New Frontiers in Scientific Research, organized by PronoKal Group and held in Barcelona, Spain. During this conference, international multidisciplinary experts in the study and management of obesity presented the latest data on the benefits of treatment based on a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet.  Ana Belén Crujeiras,\xa0BSc,\xa0PhD, principal investigator of the Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela-Galician Health Service (IDIS-SERGAS) Group of Epigenomics in Endocrinology and Nutrition and the Biomedical Research Networking Center for Obesity and Nutrition Physiopathology (CIBEROBN) commented, ""Nutritional ketosis has gained great interest in recent years because it is shown to have beneficial properties for health and promotes healthy aging, increasing longevity. Furthermore, in the case of obesity, we have more and more evidence that it is an effective treatment, mainly because to achieve this metabolic state (ketosis), routes that require the combustion of fats are activated, and this induces body weight loss  &#x200B;   The specialist stressed that several strategies are currently used to induce nutritional ketosis. They all are characterized by low carbohydrate consumption (low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet; low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet; and intermittent fasting). But Crujeiras warned that to use it as a treatment for a disease such as obesity, it must be backed by strong and solid scientific evidence, moving away from the concept of fad diets.  In this sense, since 2010, Crujeiras\' team has developed several studies focused on analyzing the efficacy and safety of treatment with a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, the results of which have been published in high-impact journals.  Crujeiras commented on the main conclusions drawn from these investigations. ""Our work has shown that the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet is effective for rapid weight loss and maintenance of lost weight, as well as reducing fat mass, primarily visceral fat mass.""  ""In this sense, a very interesting result is that despite the strong weight loss it induces, it preserves muscle mass and function and improves resting metabolic rate. These two variables are important, because all therapeutic strategies that exist to lose weight lead to a significant reduction in fat-free mass and also a reduction in energy expenditure at rest. This factor is associated with the risk of regaining lost weight, which is currently the great challenge in the treatment of obesity,"" she added.  **Specific Methylation Pattern**  Crujeiras indicated that other notable evidence is the favorable impact on an emotional and psychological level. ""To determine whether the caloric restriction of this diet and the strong weight loss that it involves were associated with an increased desire to eat, we also carried out an analysis with psychobiological tests. These results led us to conclude that this guideline is accompanied by a reduction of anxiety about food and an improvement in psychobiological parameters, thus increasing the quality of life of these patients.""  The specialist also mentioned that studies currently in progress show that the beneficial effect of this diet could be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. ""In our group, we have identified a specific DNA methylation pattern in people with obesity and we wondered if the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet would be able to reverse that methylome.  ""We [conducted a study]( in which we collected blood samples from patients on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (600 to 800 kcal/day) drawn before treatment, at peak ketosis, and at the end of treatment. After determining the global pattern of DNA in all patients with obesity targeted with this strategy and through bioinformatic analysis, we were able to obtain a methylation pattern. The results showed that after weight loss on the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet, the methylome that obese people initially had [was] reversed and matched that of normal-weight people.  ""Continuing with this bioinformatic analysis more comprehensively, we wanted to see what kind of genes were differentially methylated, especially by the action of the ketosis itself. We found that most of the genes that exhibited differential methylation (in total, 292 identified) belonged to pathways that were involved in the regulation of metabolism, adipose tissue function, CNS function, and also carcinogenesis,"" she continued.  **Immunomodulatory Effect**  Crujeiras commented that her research group also observed the modulatory role of the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet in the functioning of the immune system, ""something that was not seen after similar weight loss induced by [bariatric surgery]( We analyzed this data in the context of the situation created by COVID-19, taking into account the evidence that people with obesity, compared to those with normal weight, have a higher risk of becoming infected and of having a poor evolution of the infection.""  In this regard, Crujeiras\' team [launched an investigation]( to study the **ACE2** gene methylation pattern, comparing obesity with normal weight and the situation after following a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet or undergoing bariatric surgery. ""We observed that the methylation pattern of this gene in obese people was increased, compared to normal weight people,"" she explained, ""and this increase was observed mainly in visceral adipose tissue. However, we did not see this in subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that visceral adipose tissue is that mostly associated with obesity-related comorbidities.  ""Likewise, the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet was associated with decreased **ACE2** methylation, along with increased exposure of this gene. However, after bariatric surgery, no significant changes were observed, so we deduce that we are protecting the patient in some way from inflammation and, therefore, from the potential of serious illness if they become infected.  ""In light of these results, we wanted to dig deeper into what was happening with the immune system of obese patients and that inflammation after a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet. We conducted a new study, currently under review in the journal **Clinical Nutrition**, with the same approach, comparing this diet with a standard hypocaloric balanced diet and bariatric surgery, in which we analyzed a wide battery of cytokines (32). We have observed a differential pattern between the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet and bariatric surgery.  ""The results confirm our hypothesis that the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet remodels the inflammatory status of obese patients, and we were also able to verify that the increase in ketone bodies has immunomodulatory properties that were previously demonstrated in preclinical and animal models, which is associated with increased immune function in these patients,"" added Crujeiras.  **Personalization and Weight Regain**  In regard to the next steps to take in the knowledge and clinical application of the benefits of this dietary strategy, Crujeiras commented that despite the fact that this diet is known to be effective, it is currently prescribed in a standard manner to all patients, ""but there is some variability in the response and also a high risk of regaining weight, as is the case with any nutritional intervention strategy, with that \'regain\' of lost weight being the main challenge in the treatment of obesity. In this sense, the epigenomic and epigenetic markers that we have identified could help us optimize treatment.""
